Someone in our church helps an indigenous church in Massai land Kenya.  He gave two examples of what doesn''t work very well when evangelizing in another culture.  One example was of a certain demonination that built a nice church in the area.  But only the missionaries from this denominiation can use the church. Missionaries don''t last long in this area so there has been a pad lock on the door for years.  The inginenous church which shares the exact same gospel message with the pad locked church cannot use this building. They meet under trees.  The other example is of the same area where some Koreans have come to share the gospel with these people but are very adamant how things are done.  Their cultures are very different and they are not interested in changing the way they do things so the Christians who are there just laugh and mock the way they act.  Not good either way.

(908, 372, 'wp-svbtle-markdown', 'My list of reasons to quit Facebook has been slowly growing, but Facebook''s useful features have kept me hanging on until now. A few weeks ago I watched [an advertisement for Facebook Home](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voWvqBsyYbE) that put the final nail in the coffin.\r\n\r\nThe video portrays a girl, about my age, apparently bored at a family gathering. She does what has become an infamous habit in our world; she pulls out her phone for something more entertaining.\r\n\r\nThe fact that she is more interested in her phone than in the people around her isn''t shocking. We see this happen every day. I even see it here in the Dominican Republic. The thing that is shocking is the extent to which Facebook is celebrating and encouraging the habit. It''s offensive.\r\n\r\nThe girl in the video is the antithesis of who I want to be, but she is exactly what Facebook wants us to be, and has wanted us to be from the beginning: discontent. Facebook started as a popularity contest web page on the Harvard campus. It fed off of discontent people who were comparing themselves to others. As it has grown, it has always promised to help us connect to our friends. But it''s true driving force has never been hidden too far beneath the surface: capitalizing on our feeling of disconnectedness.\r\n\r\nThe irony is that Facebook is making us more disconnected. A quick [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=facebook+unhappy) reveals countless studies which have observed a correlation between the amount we use Facebook, and how discontent we are with our lives.\r\n\r\nI have a lot of reasons for quitting, which I explain below, but my desire to quit comes down to this;\r\n\r\n> Facebook lies. Facebook tells us that friendship should be easy and convenient, but friendship is not easy. Relationships take work, intentionality and sacrifice.\r\n\r\nI''m not saying that Facebook is evil, or that it isn''t useful for communicating with friends. For someone like me who lives internationally, Facebook is an easy and effortless way to stay in touch. I''ve just realized that, for me, Facebook isn''t the most conducive medium for building the genuine relationships that I want in my life.\r\n\r\nI no longer want my social life to be defined by passive scrolling through a "News Feed" and liking anything I find interesting while ignoring everything else. I want to connect with my friends via more intentional mediums; face to face, phone calls, email and blogs. It might be more inconvenient, more lonely or less popular, but it will be more real, and that''s what I want.\r\n\r\nIf you''re reading this, I''d like to invite you to connect with me through one of those mediums;\r\n\r\n* US Phone:  (330) 962-3620\r\n* DR Phone: (829) 404-7535\r\n* Email: josiah.sprague@gmail.com\r\n* Subscribe to my blog.\r\n\r\n## My List of Reasons To Quit Facebook\r\n1. Real friendships take real effort.\r\nNothing worth anything is cheap.The more we have to invest in a relationship, the more meaningful is becomes to us. The timeless truth is that "Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." I want my friendships to be treasured, and to require two-way investment.\r\n2. Facebook is compulsive.\r\nI don''t think I suffer from Facebook addiction, nor am I even sure that it''s possible to be addicted to Facebook. What I do know is that Facebook creates compulsive behavior. They have a financial interest in using social science to compel people to spend more time on Facebook. I don''t want to be compelled by the financial interests of a corporation.\r\n3. Facebook isn''t important.\r\nUsers are already leaving Facebook in droves, and it is becoming increasingly less relevant to a younger audience. Personally, I wouldn''t invest my money in Facebook stock, because I think it''s on it''s way out. But even if it does stick around for awhile, "those who use [Facebook], [should do so] as if not engrossed in [it]. For this world in its present form is passing away"([Source](https://www.youversion.com/bible/111/1co.7.31.niv)).\r\n\r\nIn addition to that list, I''ve been asking myself; What do you have to show for the time you''ve spent on Facebook? When was the last time you spent a meaningful hour on Facebook? How many hours have you wasted?\r\n\r\nMy conclusion is that Facebook is not a meaningful addition to my life. But I still find it useful, and had a lot of objections to quitting. In order to overcome those objections and cut Facebook out of my life, I made a list and addressed each objection individually. I''m sharing the list here for anyone else who has wanted to cut the Facebook cord, but found too many things holding them back.\r\n\r\n## Objections to Quitting Facebook\r\n1. I chat with a lot of people on Facebook\r\nFacebook is a really convenient way to chat. This is one of the things I''m going to miss the most, but there are other options for chatting. After leaving Facebook, I plan to chat via Google Talk, texting and Twitter.\r\n2. I get a lot of blog traffic through Facebook\r\nI''ve been relying on Facebook to let friends and family know when I have a new blog post. Without Facebook people won''t know when I''ve posted something new to my blog, so I''ve set my blog up so that friends and family can [subscribe via email](http://eepurl.com/pWuUX) or [RSS feed](http://josiahsprague.com/feed/). If you''re not subscribed already, please subscribe now.\r\n3. I log into a lot of other websites with my Facebook account\r\nThis is a dependency on Facebook that I developed without realizing it. I''ve signed up for so many websites using Facebook, and once I delete my Facebook, many of those accounts will be deleted as well. This was easy to solve. A few weeks ago I [turned off Facebook platform](http://lifehacker.com/5993771/the-nuclear-option-for-total-facebook-app-privacy) which disabled all apps, games, and other websites connected to my Facebook account, and I''ve been using Twitter instead as my login for third party websites.\r\n4. I use Facebook for work\r\nEvery job I''ve had since college, including [my job at Doulos](http://doulosdiscovery.org/about/our-staff/josiah-sprague/), has required me to use Facebook to administrate company pages or develop Facebook apps. I can''t fulfill those responsibilities without a Facebook account, so I created a new account without my full name, and with no friend connections or personal information so that I can login to do my job. This has an added benefit of having a lot less social distractions at work.\r\n5. I can contact anyone through Facebook\r\nThis is my fault, for being lazy and not bother to get people''s other contact information. Once I realized this, I spent some time getting other contact information from my Facebook friends and adding it to my address book. In the process I''ve realized that it''s never a good idea to trust one company with your contacts. Facebook has that stuff locked down, and it took a lot of work to get my information out. I used Google Contacts to export my address book to a open CSV file that I can store on my own computer.\r\n6. Facebook is how other people share photos with me\r\nThis was my original excuse for not quitting Facebook years ago. Facebook is a really convenient place to share photos with friends and family, and for them to share photos with you. There are definitely other options for photo sharing, and though they may not be convenient, maybe sharing less photos online will mean more opportunities to sit down side by side with someone and share photos. I think I''ve also got a narcissistic desire to see the photos that others have taken of me. I''ll miss that, but it''s probably a healthy thing to lose.\r\n7. You never know when you''ll need your Facebook network\r\nFacebook has allowed people to take advantage of their relational networks in amazing ways. A few months ago, [a friend of mine](http://caminandoporfe--jandcinthedr.blogspot.com/) was able to raise tens of thousands of dollars overnight to save the life of his newborn daughter, and his Facebook connections played a large part in that effort. While stories like that are really moving examples of the power that a social network can have, the real human connections that made that happen exist apart from Facebook. If something happens that my network needs to know about, it will be shared by those people on whatever websites they spend their time on. It doesn''t necessarily have to be Facebook, and the number of human connections that I have with others will never be determined by a friend or follower count.\r\n8. Facebook is how person X communicates.\r\nMany of my Facebook friends are students that I''ve worked with as an RA, doing urban youth ministry, and working at a school in the Dominican Republic. Facebook is the primary way that many of them communicate online - they don''t use email, Twitter, etc. A friend of mine suggested that the reason he doesn''t quit Facebook is because we wants to be able to connect with those students "on their level". I think we need mentors who are willing to connect with people wherever they are. I deeply respect those that have made the decision to be on Facebook for that reason, and I wouldn''t argue with them to change. But my perspective is that very few people connect with others on Facebook exclusively, and many students on Facebook are there to connect with their friends, not their mentors.\r\n\r\n> The real question is not whether to quit Facebook, but which medium will allow me to best connect and build relationships with the people I am trying to reach.\r\n\r\n## How Do I Quit Facebook?\r\nIf this post has got you thinking about how you can quit Facebook, You can [permanently delete your Facebook account here](https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account). That requires you to wait for two whole weeks and be careful to to use any website that you signed up for with Facebook. That''s plenty of time to second guess your decision. I wanted to have a little bit more control over my Facebook use and my decision to quit, so [this is how I plan to quit Facebook](http://www.suicidemachine.org/).'),

(1394, 427, 'wp-svbtle-markdown', 'I just got back to Ohio after a 10 month stay in the Dominican Republic. I had a great time in the Dominican; learned, accomplished and experienced a lot. Cultural adjustment was expected going in, and though I had difficult moments, overall, the adjustment of learning to engage with a new culture and language was pretty easy for me. But it changed me a lot, and the last few days of travel and reentering US culture have been an interesting view of they ways that I''ve changed.\r\n\r\nGoing through the airport in Santiago I realized how much Spanish I''ve learned in the last year. When I entered the country, everything sounded like a complete blur, and I could communicate more effectively using hand motions than anything else. On my way through the first security checkpoint, I understood enough to hear a pretty Dominican security guard tell me, "Hey redhead, you can''t take your beautiful blue eyes on the plane, we''re going to have to cut them out and leave them in this country." I still haven''t gotten very good at responding quickly in Spanish, so I just smiled-- she probably thought I didn''t understand.\r\n\r\nWatching the Dominican roads weaving through the mountains as we flew away, I felt that I had a much deeper understanding of how life looks along them than I did flying in-- it''s nothing like life along US roads. On our decent into Miami, I was impressed with how organized, planned, and orderly the city was. Cars flowing along large highways, all in their own lanes, driving with purpose from one large building to another.\r\n\r\nThe airports weren''t as shocking to me as I thought they would be, probably because I didn''t have much time to stop as I rushed through them from flight to flight, but was surprised that there was no free WiFi until Columbus. If you don''t have a cellular data plan in this country, you''re pretty much out of luck.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine picked me up at the airport and took me to a Five Iron Frenzy show. I can''t tell you how much I love ska, and how much I''ve missed being able to just dance with a crowd of people to music that I actually like. I''m not a big fan of Dominican merengue or bachata, and despite being in the Caribbean, ska isn''t very well known in the country. I wish I could share the experience with some of my more hippy friends from the DR, I know they would love it.\r\n\r\nAfter the Five Iron show, we went to IHOP. I forgot how hard it is to find an item on the menu that doesn''t have eggs here! In the Dominican, you can just ask for things without mayonnaise (which they put on everything!) and you''ll be fine. Allergies are way more convenient there.\r\n\r\nThe drive to Akron from Columbus was surreal. The highways were so huge, and empty and lonely. No businesses, people, or motorcycles along the side. It''s weird to feel like your home is a foreign country.\r\n\r\nI spent a lot of time on the highway the last three days. I drove with my family to Cincinnati for my cousin''s wedding. I hadn''t seen most of the people there since my other cousin''s wedding last year. It was shocking to see how much some people had changed; one cousin was way taller, another family member looked way older, a lot of people had gained a few pounds; or it might have just been my perception. Dominicans are really skinny.\r\n\r\nNow I''m headed to Kenmore, and I''m going to stop at the Chapel in Akron for church tonight. It will be interesting to worship in such a large place, with so many fancy lights, and to hear a sermon in English.\r\n\r\nI''m looking forward to seeing all of my friends and community. I''ve missed you all. I''m back for the summer. Let''s kick it.'),

(2824, 548, 'wp-svbtle-markdown', 'Lately, it seems like there is never enough time in the day to do all of the things on my plate. Between producing media for Doulos, teaching class, blogging, translating, attending several small groups, making websites, building a small business on the side and trying to keep my education up to date, I do a lot of things. But lately I''ve been dissatisfied; My work is mediocre by my own standards and I''m not accomplishing things that are meaningful to me.\r\n\r\nI want to do better work. I want to accomplish more meaningful things. I want to use my talents more fully. I want to love people better and build deeper relationships. I want to have time to reflect on what I''m doing. I want to use the one life that God has given me to it''s maximum potential.\r\n\r\nI need to focus my energy on doing one thing well rather doing many things with mediocrity. After spending time reflecting on my values and passions, I''ve clarified my personal vocation or calling as the following;\r\n\r\nHelping individuals and organizations serve one another via the web.\r\n\r\nMy current challenge is bring all of the aspects of my life keenly into focus on that calling. My ideal career involves two parts. The first is craftsmanship, and the second is apprenticeship. My vision is a work in progress, but I want to share with you how I see those parts playing out in my near future.\r\n\r\nCraftsmanship\r\nCraftsmanship means using one''s gifts and talents to skillfully create high quality work and design. My vision is to form a business that will craft high quality websites for a variety of clients and to cultivate and increase the market value of those individuals and organizations via the web medium.\r\n\r\nI have already established a small base of six initial clients for this company. While I am very familiar with my craft, I have a lot to learn concerning running a business, so I am currently working with Fourth Water, a local business accelerator in Jarabacoa, and developing a formal business plan.\r\n\r\nApprenticeship\r\nThe word "apprenticeship" is related to the Spanish word "aprender--to learn" and it means learning via practical experience from a skilled professional. I believe that both being an apprentice and having apprentices is vital to quality work and craftsmanship. My vision is to merge my role as a constantly learning professional with my role as a teacher.\r\n\r\nThis past semester I had the opportunity to teach an elective communication class at Doulos Discovery School in Jarabacoa. This coming semester, inspired by my passion for the web and students requesting to learn computer programming, I am developing plans to teach a programming elective for high school and a code club for elementary school. My long term vision is to be able to connect these students with hands on experiences to learn via the business that I am forming.\r\n\r\nThe specifics of this vision are still forming, and there is a long way to go. My desire is that they will continue to become clearer and more focused and that the end result will be a fruitful investment of the time and talents that God has given me.\r\n\r\nI covet your advice, prayers and continued support while this vision evolves and grows. If you''d like to discuss this in more detail, please feel free to contact me, I''d love to share more with you.'),

On April 14-21, 2012, I will be going with a team from<a href="http://mosaicneo.com/">Mosaic church</a> in Stow, OH to <a href="http://www.doulosdiscovery.org/">Doulos Discovery School</a> in Jarobacoa. The mission of the school is “to educate and disciple servant leaders in the Dominican Republic”.\r\n\r\n<img src="http://josiahsprague.com/doulos/img/photo.jpg" class="polaroid" alt="Doulos Discovery School" />We will have the opportunity to help and encourage teachers during the most important and demanding week of their year, <a href="http://www.doulosdiscovery.org/expeditions.htm">expeditionary week</a>. We will be working alongside teachers and kids, finishing projects, testing students, and providing manual labor for other jobs around campus. We will also have the opportunity to work alongside students and teachers as they bring water filter systems and clean water education to the surrounding communities.\r\n\r\nThis will be an opportunity for us to share the love of Christ, and an experience that will impact my life and influence my ability to serve others with a greater understanding and capacity and I want to invite you to be a part of the whole process by praying for my team before we go, while we are there, and after the trip. I will be posting updates on Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/jo_Osiah">@jo_Osiah</a>) while we are there. I know God is doing great things, and I am excited that I get to be a part of what He is doing!\r\n\r\nIn order to go on this trip, I need to raise $1500 rather quickly. If you are willing to support me financially, any amount will go along way. You can donate online or, if you''d like your donation to be tax deductible, by <a href="#footnote">sending a check made out to Mosaic*</a>.

Danae and I went to high school together at CVCA, and I am so blessed to be working with her and her husband Dan for the next three years. Dan will be the Expedition Coordinator at Doulos, and Danae will be the Instructional Coach for our teaching staff. Anginette went to CVCA as well, and just graduated this year. She will be at Doulos for the next semester to kick off her college career with Moody Bible Institute.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/a653d9c2df0611e1b62322000a1e8a75_7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-25" title="a653d9c2df0611e1b62322000a1e8a75_7" alt="Guard tower in the parking lot." src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/a653d9c2df0611e1b62322000a1e8a75_7-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nOur flight was extremely smooth, and once we touched down in Santiago, we met with Tim, the Managing Director of Doulos, who drove us into Jarabacoa. On the way, we stopped to get groceries for dinner at La Sirena (the mermaid), which is more or less the Dominican version of WalMart.

You may be surprised, as I was, that pine trees are very common in the Dominican Republic. Another thing that is very common are the mosquitoes. Our first couple of days here, they couldn''t get enough of our fresh, North American blood. Insects are and lizards are the largest wild animals here. The scariest wildlife I''ve seen so far is a praying mantis, which is more amazing than scary.

A few of us spent a few hours shoveling gravel, for which our bodies are still punishing us, and I got to spend a lot of time carving wooden signs for some new classrooms. Building things with my hands was a nice change from a 9 to 5 office environment.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/50c3fefadde511e19fb4123138101461_7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-29" title="50c3fefadde511e19fb4123138101461_7" alt="Carving signs for the new Doulos classrooms." src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/50c3fefadde511e19fb4123138101461_7-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nThere are other changes from my usual routine that have been a little harder to adjust to, such as how laundry is done here. Some people have fully automatic laundry, as in the states, but it is very common here to do laundry with a semi-automatic washer, and then dry it on the line. It takes more time and patience, and it''s not so compatible with my usual procrastination when it comes to laundry.

In a culture where I feel lost 95% of the time, it is an absolutely amazing sensation of solidarity to realize that we know the same loving father that takes care of all of our needs.\n\n<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ecebb50cda3911e1aeb3123138150f49_7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-31" title="ecebb50cda3911e1aeb3123138150f49_7" src="http://josiahsprague.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ecebb50cda3911e1aeb3123138150f49_7-300x300.jpg" alt="Bi-cultural worship." width="300" height="300" /></a>\n\nThe very though of His love brings rest in a time and place where everything takes intentional effort for me. But I am tired, if you''re one for praying, pray that I would spend more time resting in His love, seeking His presence and listening to and trusting His voice. I have worries, like whether I will be able to communicate well in Spanish, whether I will build strong relationships here, whether all of the support that I need will come in, and whether or not I will excel at my job here.\n\nTo be honest, I spend much less time trusting God than I should. But I am thankful that I am here, with all of my familiar surroundings and comfortable retreats removed, where God''s love is the only comfort that I know. It brings to mind a quote that my Grandma loves to remind me of;\n<blockquote>youths grow weary and tired,\nAnd vigorous young men stumble badly,\n\n<strong>31</strong> Yet those who wait for the LORD\nWill gain new strength;\nThey will mount up <em>with </em>wings like eagles,\nThey will run and not get tired,\nThey will walk and not become weary.</blockquote>\n&nbsp;', 'M New Home', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '22-revision-v1', '', '', '2012-08-06 19:32:34', '2012-08-06 19:32:34', '', 22, 'http://josiahsprague.com/blog/22-revision/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Danae and I went to high school together at CVCA, and I am so blessed to be working with her and her husband Dan for the next three years. Dan will be the Expedition Coordinator at Doulos, and Danae will be the Instructional Coach for our teaching staff. Anginette went to CVCA as well, and just graduated this year.

On the way, we stopped to get groceries for dinner at La Sirena (the mermaid), which is more or less the Dominican version of WalMart. Parking lot security is taken very seriously here, and they have watchmen in towers to guard the cars.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/a8252022dc3f11e1979222000a1e8aa2_7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-26" title="a8252022dc3f11e1979222000a1e8aa2_7" src="http://josiahsprague.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/a8252022dc3f11e1979222000a1e8aa2_7-300x300.jpg" alt="Jarabacoa" width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis is Jarabacoa, our new home, seen from the mountains.

(36, 1, '2009-05-21 20:08:19', '2009-05-21 20:08:19', 'Looking around on the internet, I''m finding some trends as far as what makes a website successful. This is my no means a definitive list, but rather a quick summary of some things that I am drawn to on the web and why I think these things are essential for a successful website. While many of my observations apply to websites in general, my specific focus will be on portfolio websites.\r\n<h2>Some Rules of Successful Design</h2>\r\nWhat makes a website successful is, first and foremost, it''s purpose. The purpose of a website is to communicate a message. The message needs to be clearly defined, and every aspect of the website should do it''s part to communicate that message. All of the aspects of a website are secondary to the message of the site.\r\n\r\nThe message of a portfolio website is, most likely, "Hire me!". This message should be made clear, and supported by the content of the site. A successful portfolio site will include examples of work to communicate the author''s skill, as well as a call to action encouraging visitors to consider hiring.\r\n\r\nSome supporting factors that make any website effective in communicating a message include; consistent navigation, usable search, standards compliance, up to date information and effective monetization.\r\n<h2>Some Things to Avoid</h2>\r\nIn light of a website''s message, anything that does not contribute to or enhance the message should be avoided. A feature may be a powerful communication tool on one website and completely out of place on another. For example, a discussion board may be a very useful tool on a social media website, but on a professional portfolio it may be out of place.\r\n\r\nOther things to avoid are unnecessary Flash animations, sounds that play automatically, and features that use large amounts of resources. These things can be used occasionally in the right places but to use them all the time is sort of like putting salt on everything you eat. Not everything needs it, and sometimes it''s better without.\r\n<h2>Good Examples</h2>\r\nThere is no shortage of good examples of portfolio websites.  DesignM.ag has a list of <a title="101 Awesome Portfolio Sites" href="http://designm.ag/inspiration/101-awesome-portfolio-sites/" target="_blank">101 Awesome Portfolio Sites.</a> The number one thing that I like about most of these portfolio sites is that they are standards compliant. It might not seem like a big deal, but standards compliance is the backbone of a successful site. Everything is built out of code, so if the code is healthy, it lends itself to a healthy site.\r\n\r\nThe first site on DesignM.ag''s list is <a title="Spoon Graphics" href="http://www.spoongraphics.co.uk/" target="_blank">Spoon Graphics</a>. Not only does the site look great, but it achieves its purpose effectively. The first thing a visitor to the site sees is the banner across the middle of the page explaining what the site is and offering links to find out more, view the portfolio or hire Chris, the owner of the site.\r\n\r\nAnother portfolio that stands out to me from the list is <a title="Design Disease" href="http://designdisease.com/" target="_blank">Design Disease</a>. The thing that draws me to this site is the creative design. The site incorporates an ocean theme while still maintaining a site that is easy to navigate. Design Disease also includes several other features that make it a successful portfolio including consistent navigation, usable search, standards compliance, up to date information and effective monetization.\r\n\r\nI especially like Design Disease''s natural approach to monetization. First by simply offering services for hire, but also by offering the services of other companies such as HostGator for web hosting. Many websites try to increase revenue by placing banner ads chosen by key word, but Design Disease simply makes a natural recommendation. Just as a side-note, this is where I see the future of advertising headed.\r\n<h2>Bad Examples</h2>\r\nPoorly designed portfolio sites are naturally harder to find, as they don''t get as much attention, but some of the worst of the worst can be found by doing a Google search for "worst website ever". There are some websites, which I generally dislike. These aren''t necessarily bad websites, but sites that I feel could do a much better job at communicating their message.\r\n\r\nHave a look at the introduction page on <a title="Scott Rockers'' Portfolio" href="http://rockerssoft.org/scott/" target="_blank">Scott Rockers'' Portfolio</a>. While I can appreciate the intent to make sure that visitors are aware that the site is Flash-based, the introduction page is an unnecessary step for most visitors that gets in the way of the message of the site. The best solution would be to avoid Flash unless it is absolutely necessary (most multimedia and animations can be handled with HTML, CSS and JavaScript these days). However, even when Flash is necessary the question of whether or not the visitor has Flash player installed can be addressed by the computer. Don''t make visitors do the work that your website should do for them. Include a script to skip the intro page if Flash is installed.\r\n\r\nOne last example is <a title="Eyes Go Dark" href="http://eyesgodark.com" target="_blank">Eyes Go Dark</a>. Eyes Go Dark is an example of a great message that is poorly communicated. When the site first loads, there is an introduction page with several external links. While external links are fine, it doesn''t make sense for them to be the first thing a visitor sees. That''s like visiting a house and being shown the way out as you enter. Skip the intro page and show visitors what they came for. Your message and your content should be right up front welcoming the visitors to your site.', 'Basic Principles of Website Design', '', 'private', 'open', 'open', '', 'basic-principles-of-website-design', '', '', '2014-03-02 19:48:50', '2014-03-02 19:48:50', '', 0, 'http://josiahsprague.wordpress.com/?p=6', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Campus Focus is the second largest student organization at the University of Akron and growing in size. While many churches are losing attendance from the college age crowd, Campus Focus is growing.\n\nMany college students imagine church is about old people wearing their Sunday best and singing hymns, but students at Campus Focus are interested in something different. Brian Kunkler, the pastor at Campus Focus, explains what Campus Focus is about to a group of students,\n<blockquote>The God that we follow around here has a bigger vision for your life than you have for your life. The God who lingers around here, whom we’re going to sing songs to in just a minute, has a bigger dream for your life than you have for your own life and He’s desperate to lead you in it. This is a high change environment.</blockquote>\nCampus Focus is a collection of college students, from many different backgrounds who have come together in the name of Jesus Christ. All are welcome, regardless of their current beliefs, gender, race, social status or lifestyle. But Brian concludes his speech to students with a warning;\n<blockquote>Look at what happened to people when they lingered around Jesus. Here’s a sampling from the four gospels. The blind see. The lame walk.  The oppressed set free. The outcasts are welcomed as family. The prostitutes become women of honor. The tax collectors become servants of the true king. Common fishermen become world changers. Swindlers and cheats pay back what they stole, and even get generous. The guilty get forgiven. The sin stain get cleansed. The proud get humbled and the self-righteous bow the knee. Wherever Jesus is, change is soon to follow.</blockquote>\nThe Campus Focus website, <a title="campusfocus.org" href="http://www.campusfocus.org" target="_blank">campusfocus.org </a>welcomes students to come to a weekly meeting at <a title="The Chapel in Akron" href="http://www.the-chapel.org" target="_blank">The Chapel in Akron</a> every Thursday night at 7:30 to see what they are all about. You can also find a weekly podcast from Campus Focus on the website.\n\nDISCLOSURE: Campus Focus is a student organization at <a title="The University of Akron" href="http://www.uakron.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Akron</a> of which I am an active participant.

(38, 1, '2009-09-15 22:03:15', '2009-09-15 22:03:15', 'There is often an awkward dynamic on the edge of urban college campuses where affluence meets poverty. <a title="The University of Akron" href="http://www.uakron.edu" target="_blank">The University of Akron</a> is far from being an exception. It is a daily ritual on the edges of Akron''s campus; that awkward moment as a busy student passes a panhandler at a street corner or bus stop.\n\nSome hold signs, others tell stories. Some are visibly drunk or high, others are dirty. But the request is predictable; "My car ran out of gas around the corner. Can you help me out? I need a couple of bucks for a gas can...", "I haven''t eaten in two days and I''m hungry, do you have a ten so I can go get a pizza?", "My girl just left me with two kids and I''m just trying to get forty bucks to pay my electric bill."\n\nIt''s sad to see men and women in such distress. It evokes feelings of sympathy and a desire to help someone out. Yet helping these people often ends with the nagging thought that maybe giving money away to a stranger isn''t helping all that much. What if your sympathy is being taken advantage of? What if you''re actually feeding a person''s addiction and not the person? It''s hard not to wonder about the stranger''s motives.\n\nAccording to a <a title="Panhandling Brochurch [PDF]" href="http://www.downtownakron.com/_files/docs/panhandling-brochure.pdf">brochure</a> available from <a title="The Downtown Akron Partnership" href="http://downtownakron.com/" target="_blank">The Downtown Akron Partnership</a> most panhandlers are not homeless. In many cases, giving money to panhandlers  supports drug and alcohol addiction. Sometimes the best response is to just politely say no. Duane Crabbs, a street pastor of <a title="South Street Ministries Blog" href="http://southstreetministries.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">South Street Ministries</a> in Akron, says that when a person is struggling with addiction, almost anything you try to do for them is enabling their addiction.\n\nSympathy towards those in need is an appropriate response, but students should be wise about their giving. A number of organizations exist in and around Akron to help those in need. Students interested in giving can give to a local organization and when encountering a person in need, students can help by directing them to the appropriate organization. Students can refer to the <a title="Akron Street Card [PDF]" href="http://www.cvmsummit.net/Street%20Card%202009.pdf" target="_blank">Akron Street Card</a> for  a list of resources for those on the streets in Akron. The street card includes information about hundreds of organizations that can help with things from emergencies, to paying utilities, to getting fed and finding work.\n\nBut according to the <a title="The Haven of Rest" href="http://www.havenofrest.org" target="_blank">Haven of Rest</a>, sometimes what panhandlers truly lack is not money but bonds with others;  what many people are suffering from is a "profound disconnection from other people and institutions". Ryan Wells, a nursing student at the University of Akron, decided to face this need head on and get to know one of the panhandlers on campus;\n<blockquote>I’ve had the opportunity to get to know a gentleman who has been out of work for almost a year now. He’s got a place to crash, but no steady income, no stability. And after getting to know him, a lot of my hesitations proved true. Drugs were involved, alcohol too. But I’ve gotten to know and appreciate this man’s struggle. I can’t stress the importance of simply learning their story. Where are they at physically? Emotionally? Mentally? Spiritually? How are you really going to effectively help anyone without learning why they are the way they are? And I’ve found companionship and communication have served this man so much better than a 10-spot and a Tornado Burrito from Speedway ever could.</blockquote>\nPanhandlers are people with the same basic needs as anyone else. Don''t be afraid to get to know a panhandler. Ask them about their story. You may be surprised at what you gain from getting to know them, and they gain a friend in return. A good place to start is lunch in a public place. Not to feed them, but to sit down with them and get to know them.\n\nDISCLOSURE: This was written for a class I am enrolled in at <a title="The University of Akron" href="http://www.uakron.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Akron</a>.

Yes, I do know “right is wrong” and no, I am not coming out. Getting my right ear pierced is something that I’ve been thinking about doing for awhile. I finally did it. This is my explanation.\n\nOriginally, the only men who wore earrings were bond servants. In the Bible, in the Old Testament, when a person owned a slave, the slave was to serve him for six years and in the seventh year go free. But, when the seventh year came around it was not uncommon for a freed slave to voluntarily re-enter service to the master he loved. The master would take him to the doorpost and pierce his <a href="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=850&amp;letter=S">right ear</a> with an awl and the slave would become his bond servant for life. Only a freed slave could become a bond servant and once he had entered that service, he could never be freed again, nor could he be sold into slavery to another master. (Exodus 21:2-7)\n\nIn the New Testament, early Christians called themselves bond servants of Christ. Bond service is a two way commitment. The freed slave chooses to commit his life to the service of his master and his master commits himself to the bond servant, never to release or sell him. (Galatians 1:10, Philippians 2:7, Colossians 1:7, 2 Timothy 2:24)\n\nJesus has committed Himself to us. With His own blood, He paid our debt and freed us from the slavery of sin. We are free to serve whomever we choose. I choose Jesus, the one who loves me and gave Himself for me. He has made a commitment to love me. I have made a commitment to serve only Him. So, I got my ear pierced as symbol to all that I am a servant by choice and can neither be bought or sold.', 'Left is Right and Right is Wrong', '', 'private', 'open', 'open', '', 'left-is-right-and-right-is-wrong', '', '', '2014-03-02 19:48:50', '2014-03-02 19:48:50', '', 0, 'http://josiahsprague.wordpress.com/?p=34', 0, 'post', '', 0),

The book is full of challenges. While reflecting on my reading of the book, I wrote the following journal entry;\n<blockquote>Christ is not easy to follow. He promises life to the full, but it is not an extension of more of the things I want and admire. Full life is not in any way for my glory. but just the opposite. In order for the life and glory of God to increase in my life, I must become less. I must be willing to abandon myself, my glory and my lusts and ego, and follow Christ in death. This is difficult. Without faith in Christ, the son of God, it is impossible.</blockquote>\nI have been challenged lately to realized that following Jesus is not glamorous or sucessful. That thought doesn’t sit comfortably for me. My humanity has a natural aversion to suffering. I want as much success as possible. A quick quote from the book that caught my attention;\n<blockquote>The life of Jesus is not a happy story, not a success story. What it is… is a salvation story.</blockquote>\nI am learning more and more that following God means denying self. No matter how moral or compassionate or virtuous self may be at times, we must lose our lives to find them. Another quote that caught my attention is;\n<blockquote>The glory with which Jesus was glorified and the glory for which Jesus prayed for us is quite different from the kinds of glory that we are conditioned to want and admire. This glory is not conspicuous. It is not glamorous. It is not the glory that gets featured in glossy magazines or travel posters. It is not a glory noticed by fashion editors. It is not a glory that flatters our lusts and egos.</blockquote>\nIt is our natural tendency to use God for our own glory. But God’s glory is entirely other than our own.

That''s when I had to start asking myself what we were doing; We''re turning people away? From a free community picnic? Did we just turn that guy away because he looked homeless? Even if he is homeless, he still lives in the community- we ought to be ashamed if we are <a title="Isaiah 58:7 on BlueLetterBible.com" href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Isa&amp;c=58&amp;t=NIV#7" target="_blank">turning away our own flesh and blood</a>.\n\nI turned to someone and asked, "If someone is a member of the community, should they not be invited to the picnic?"\n\n"No, we didn''t invite sex offenders and criminals. We skipped the houses of sex offenders and criminals when we passed out fliers."\n\nI was frustrated that we were having this picnic to build a sense of community in the neighborhood so that future crime would be reduced and that everyone in the community was invited, except anyone with a criminal record. Oh, and anyone who looked dirty or unshaven, was being turned away too.\n\nI was wondering how many people at the picnic actually live in the neighborhood compared to people who were students just staying in the neigborhood temporarily. Associated Student Government kept track of who attended, so I got in touch with their office to get some statistics.\n\nThe statistics from the first Zipnic, which I attended weren''t very detailed- 281 people signed in. I didn''t attend the second picnic, but according to the statistics,  only 26% of the 351 people at the picnic were non-students. I can''t help but wonder if that percentage would have been higher if we hadn''t excluded those who don''t fit into our college student social class.\n\nAre these statistics a big deal? Not really... but are they indicative of a bigger problem? I think they may be... more thoughts later.', 'Community Zipnic Stats', '', 'private', 'open', 'open', '', 'community-zipnic-stats', '', '', '2014-03-02 19:48:23', '2014-03-02 19:48:23', '', 0, 'http://josiahsprague.wordpress.com/?p=87', 0, 'post', '', 0),

I left it locked up by itself outside of Grant Residence Hall a week before classes started. I left it for a week, and when I came back for it, it was gone. In retrospect, I should have known better.\n\nPreventing theft is common sense, but sometimes we all need a little reminder. Hopefully it doesn''t take your bike getting stolen to remind you. I got an email from the University of Akron this weekend with a few useful tips for preventing theft. Some reminders based on their email;\n<ul type="disc">\n	<li>Don''t leave valuables where they are going to catch attention, like your car seat or the front window of your house. If potential thieves never see your valuables, they won''t be tempted.</li>\n	<li>Don''t leave valuables unsecured. Most thefts are crimes of opportunity. Thieves keep their eyes open for opportunities, but most thieves aren''t willing to do the work to make opportunities- don''t make the opportunities for them.</li>\n	<li>If you have valuables you are worried about losing, consider getting insurance coverage and/or an alarm system.</li>\n	<li>If you notice anything suspicious, let UA’s police department know. Call the department at 330-972-2911 at any hour.</li>\n</ul>\nThese are some good tips to remember. I''d like to add one more of my own that most people probably won''t like, but that I believe is the most important and timeless piece of advice;\n<ul>\n	<li>Don''t have a lot of stuff. There are better ways to invest your wealth than in material things.

I heard it justified as "safety", but I''m calling it how I see it. This was a picnic in the middle of the day, with plenty of watchful eyes and UAPD around, this was a safe place to interact with anyone save a militant terrorist. Excluding people from the picnic wasn''t a matter of safety, it was class discrimination. If someone didn''t appear to meet the standard of being a middle class college student with a clean record, they were discriminated against.\n\nStudents at <a href="http://www.uakron.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Akron</a> don''t hear a lot about class discrimination in <a title="The City of Akron on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akron,_Ohio" target="_blank">Akron</a>.

The truth is that our community is made up of two distinct social classes. The edge of a college campus in an urban setting is a place where poverty and affluence meet. It is a place where class discrimination can very easily sneak in if we are not intentional about avoiding it.\n\nI''d like to see the University of Akron have a picnic for the community that doesn''t discriminate based on class. <a title="Article 27 of the UDHR" href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a27" target="_blank">Article 27</a> of the <a title="UDHR" href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/" target="_blank">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> states that, "Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community."

(301, 1, '2013-03-05 19:48:57', '2013-03-05 19:48:57', 'In the last several years I''ve witnessed poverty in many different forms and contexts ranging from poverty in urban areas of Akron, Ohio to poverty in rural areas of the Dominican Republic. Poverty takes on so many different forms that it is often hard to recognize what poverty really means. I''ve seen the poverty of the homeless man, who gets $10,000 a year begging on a street corner and spends it all on a heroine addiction. I''ve seen the poverty of a teenager who has a Playstation 3 and unlimited supply of Mountain Dew, but who has absent parents and struggles to succeed in school. And I''ve seen the poverty of a loving family who does everything together, but eats rice and beans and lives in a wooden shack next to a sewage filled river.\n\nI''ve struggled with trying to make sense of all of these different experiences. How can a poor child from a developing country who can''t even afford a computer do so much better in school than a kid who''s got access to high speed internet and a school full of educational technology? How can a family that lives in a tiny shack with a dirt floor be more satisfied with their lives than a man that makes $75,000 a year and drives a new sports car? How can we say we have poverty in America, when compared with the developing world, we don''t even know what it means to lack material resources? How can we say that the developing world is poor, when they''re among the happiest countries in the world?\n\nRecently, I''ve been reading <a href="http://amzn.to/XU6RYb">When Helping Hurts</a>, a book about helping the poor in a way that doesn''t do more harm than good. The book challenges the common idea that poverty means a lack of material resources. The book quotes several people talking about their own experience of being poor. They described how they felt using words like; shame, unwanted, uncomfortable, depressed, unhappy, alone, powerless, unheard, stuck.\n\nAs I read their definitions of poverty, I was struck by how much these words resonated with me; They are all things I have experienced first hand. As I was thinking about their words, someone said to me, "All of us are poor because we all have a disconnect from God". Boom. Everything suddenly clicked for me. Poverty is not a lack of stuff. Poverty is a disconnect; a broken relationship with ourselves, with other people, with creation and with God.\n<blockquote>"All of us are poor because we all have a disconnect from God"</blockquote>\nJesus said that <a href="https://www.youversion.com/bible/111/mat.26.11.niv">there will always be poor people in the world</a>. The word that is translated as poor in our Bible is the Greek word ptōchos (πτωχός) which is also translated as broken, or lowly. We have all experienced poverty in one form or another. We have all felt broken. We all know what it feels like and how much it hurts. But Jesus also said another interesting thing about ptōchos. In the beatitudes he says "Blessed are the ptōchos, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven".\n\nJesus says that the broken, unwanted and powerless are not just permitted to be a part of his family, but they have actually been given part ownership of it. They''re no longer lacking wealth, but they''re shareholders in the central organization of the universe. They''re not alone, powerless or unheard, but connected, empowered, loved and valued. In our world, being poor is a curse, but in his world, in his kingdom, it is a blessing.\n\nWe know that poverty will always be with us, but Jesus also tells us, and we can tell others, that poverty is not permanent; our brokenness will be healed, and in fact, is already being healed. We are all poor. Because true poverty isn''t a lack of stuff, but broken relationships. And we are all blessed. Because the truth is that God''s kingdom has been given to us.\n\nPoverty is a lie. The truth is ... made in the image of God with power.\n\n&nbsp;', 'What is Poverty?', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '300-revision', '', '', '2013-03-05 19:48:57', '2013-03-05 19:48:57', '', 300, 'http://josiahsprague.com/300-revision/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Implying that it was wrong for guys to work for bigger biceps. This week, he asked for a <a title="What is a Mulligan?" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulligan" target="_blank">Mulligan</a> because he believes that Christians should do whatever they do for the glory of God, even if that "whatever" is working for bigger biceps.\n\nBrian talked about <a title="Colossians 3 - Blue Letter Bible" href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Col&amp;c=3&amp;t=NIV" target="_blank">Colossians 3</a>. He sees a grid of three things that Christians should run their activities through;\n<ol>\n	<li><strong>"Put to death" things that go against the revealed moral will of God.</strong> The things listed in Colossians 3.5-8 that go against the moral will of God include; sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, greed (which is idolatry), anger, rage, malice, slander and filthy language.</li>\n	<li><strong>Whose glory are we seeking?</strong> God has given us value as human beings and it is not anything we have to work for or earn. Colossians 3.11 says that Christ takes away any human measures of value- everyone is equally valuable (student, non-student, homeless, healthy, black, white, gay, straight...). Whatever Christians do should not be to earn respect from people, but to give glory to God.</li>\n	<li><strong>"Clothe yourselves with" virtues of God''s character.</strong> The virtues listed in Colossians 3.12 include; compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, patience, forgiveness (as Christ forgave you), and love, which binds all of these virtues together in unity.</li>\n</ol>\nTo sum up these three parts of the grid, Brian points to Colossians 3.17; "Whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God the Father."\n\nThe second part of the grid hit me really hard. Everything that I have been doing this semester has been motivated by a desire to earn people''s respect (my professors, my residents, my boss, my girlfriend, my small group, my roommates, etc).

If I am seeking to bless myself with these things I am probably not seeking God''s glory (so that people will worship God when they see how wonderfully He has made me) but I am seeking my own glory (so that people will respect me when they see the man that I have made myself to be).\n\n(Check out <a title="Campus Focus Podcast" href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=326679776" target="_blank">the weekly podcast of Campus Focus </a>to hear Brian''s message from this week as well as previous weeks.)', 'Mulligan', '', 'private', 'open', 'open', '', 'mulligan', '', '', '2014-03-02 19:48:23', '2014-03-02 19:48:23', '', 0, 'http://josiahsprague.wordpress.com/?p=104', 0, 'post', '', 0),

I told him that I didn''t have one, but asked if I could give him what I do have; prayer. I had expected that he would say yes, sort of as an obligation for me buying him food, but instead his face lit up and he said, "I need that!", another man sitting on the bench said, "Hey! Can I get some of that too?"

There are even rumors floating around the internet that you can open a locked car with a <a title="Opening a Locked Car with a Cell Phone" href="http://www.snopes.com/autos/techno/keyless.asp" target="_blank">cell phone</a> or a <a title="Opening a Locked Car with a Tennis Ball" href="http://www.autoblog.com/2007/07/12/can-you-really-open-a-locked-door-with-a-tennis-ball/" target="_blank">tennis ball</a>.

Most dealers can provide a replacement key for around five dollars. Just make sure you''re not paying the "programming fee" for newer cars, you just need the key to open the door, not start your car.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Call roadside assistance</strong> such as <a href="http://www.aaa.com" target="_blank">AAA</a> or <a href="www.onstar.com" target="_blank">OnStar</a>. These companies can send out a reputable locksmith to help you and if you are a member, the service may be included in your membership.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Call the police</strong> and ask if they can help. Many police will not open locked car doors because they do not want to be held responsible for possible damage to your car, but some police may still help so it''s worth a call. If a child or a pet is trapped in the car, police will help, call 911 if it is an emergency.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Call a local locksmith</strong> if you can find a phone book, or if you live near Akron you can use Akron Locksmith''s 24/7 Emergency Service, just call (330) 375-5260.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Use a coat hanger</strong> to unlock the door yourself.

(372, 1, '2013-05-01 17:24:27', '2013-05-01 17:24:27', 'My list of reasons to quit Facebook has been slowly growing, but Facebook''s useful features have kept me hanging on until now. A few weeks ago I watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voWvqBsyYbE">an advertisement for Facebook Home</a> that put the final nail in the coffin.\r\n\r\nThe video portrays a girl, about my age, apparently bored at a family gathering. She does what has become an infamous habit in our world; she pulls out her phone for something more entertaining.\r\n\r\nThe fact that she is more interested in her phone than in the people around her isn''t shocking. We see this happen every day. I even see it here in the Dominican Republic. The thing that is shocking is the extent to which Facebook is celebrating and encouraging the habit. It''s offensive.\r\n\r\nThe girl in the video is the antithesis of who I want to be, but she is exactly what Facebook wants us to be, and has wanted us to be from the beginning: <em>discontent</em>. Facebook started as a popularity contest web page on the Harvard campus. It fed off of discontent people who were comparing themselves to others. As it has grown, it has always promised to help us connect to our friends. But it''s true driving force has never been hidden too far beneath the surface: <em>capitalizing on our feeling of disconnectedness</em>.\r\n\r\nThe irony is that Facebook is making us more disconnected. A quick <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=facebook+unhappy">Google search</a> reveals countless studies which have observed a correlation between the amount we use Facebook, and how discontent we are with our lives.\r\n\r\nI have a lot of reasons for quitting, which I explain below, but my desire to quit comes down to this;\r\n<blockquote>Facebook lies. Facebook tells us that friendship should be easy and convenient, but friendship is not easy. Relationships take work, intentionality and sacrifice.</blockquote>\r\nI''m not saying that Facebook is evil, or that it isn''t useful for communicating with friends. For someone like me who lives internationally, Facebook is an easy and effortless way to stay in touch. I''ve just realized that, for me, Facebook isn''t the most conducive medium for building the genuine relationships that I want in my life.\r\n\r\nI no longer want my social life to be defined by passive scrolling through a "News Feed" and liking anything I find interesting while ignoring everything else. I want to connect with my friends via more intentional mediums; face to face, phone calls, email and blogs. It might be more inconvenient, more lonely or less popular, but it will be more real, and that''s what I want.\r\n\r\nIf you''re reading this, I''d like to invite you to connect with me through one of those mediums;\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>US Phone: (330<span style="display: none;">000</span>) 962<span style="display: none;">000</span>-3620<span style="display: none;">000</span></li>\r\n	<li>DR Phone: (829<span style="display: none;">000</span>) 404<span style="display: none;">000</span>-7535<span style="display: none;">000</span></li>\r\n	<li>Email: josiah<span style="display: none;">000</span>.sprague<span style="display: none;">000</span>@gmail<span style="display: none;">000</span>.<span style="display: none;">000</span>com</li>\r\n	<li>Subscribe to my blog: <a href="http://josiahsprague.com/feed/">RSS Feed</a>, <a href="http://eepurl.com/pWuUX">Via Email</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>List of Reasons To Quit Facebook</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Real friendships take real effort.</strong>\r\nNothing worth anything is cheap.The more we have to invest in a relationship, the more meaningful is becomes to us. The timeless truth is that "Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." I want my friendships to be treasured, and to be built on two-way investment.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Facebook is compulsive.</strong>\r\nI don''t think I suffer from Facebook addiction, nor am I even sure that it''s possible to be addicted to Facebook. What I do know is that Facebook creates compulsive behavior. They have a financial interest in using social science to compel people to spend more time on Facebook. I don''t want to be compelled by the financial interests of a corporation.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Facebook isn''t important.</strong>\r\n<a href="http://www.opposingviews.com/i/technology/internet/millions-users-leaving-facebook">Millions of people are already leaving Facebook</a>, and it is becoming increasingly less relevant to a younger audience. Personally, I wouldn''t invest my money in Facebook stock, because I think it''s on it''s way out. But even if it does stick around for awhile, "those who use [Facebook], [should do so] as if not engrossed in [it]. For this world in its present form is passing away" (<a href="https://www.youversion.com/bible/111/1co.7.31.niv">Source</a>). That has made me ask myself; What do you have to show for the time you''ve spent on Facebook? When was the last time you spent a meaningful hour on Facebook? How many hours have you wasted?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nMy conclusion is that Facebook is not a meaningful addition to my life. But I still find it useful, and had a lot of objections to quitting. In order to overcome those objections and cut Facebook out of my life, I made a list and addressed each objection individually. I''m sharing the list here for anyone else who has wanted to cut the Facebook cord, but found too many things holding them back.\r\n<h2>Objections to Quitting Facebook</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>I chat with a lot of people on Facebook.</strong>\r\nFacebook is a really convenient way to chat. This is one of the things I''m going to miss the most, but there are other options for chatting. After leaving Facebook, I plan to chat via Google Talk, texting and Twitter.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>I get a lot of blog traffic through Facebook.</strong>\r\nI''ve been relying on Facebook to let friends and family know when I have a new blog post. Without Facebook people won''t know when I''ve posted something new to my blog, so I''ve set my blog up so that friends and family can <a href="http://eepurl.com/pWuUX">subscribe via email</a> or <a href="http://josiahsprague.com/feed/">RSS feed</a>. If you''re not subscribed already, please subscribe now.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>I log into a lot of other websites with my Facebook account.</strong>\r\nThis is a dependency on Facebook that I developed without realizing it. I''ve signed up for so many websites using Facebook, and once I delete my Facebook, many of those accounts will be deleted as well. This was easy to solve. A few weeks ago I <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5993771/the-nuclear-option-for-total-facebook-app-privacy">turned off Facebook platform</a> which disabled all apps, games, and other websites connected to my Facebook account, and I''ve been using Twitter instead as my login for third party websites.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>I use Facebook for work.</strong>\r\nEvery job I''ve had since college, including <a href="http://doulosdiscovery.org/about/our-staff/josiah-sprague/">my job at Doulos</a>, has required me to use Facebook to administrate company pages or develop Facebook apps. I can''t fulfill those responsibilities without a Facebook account, so I created a new account without my full name, and with no friend connections or personal information so that I can login to do my job. This has an added benefit of having a lot less social distractions at work.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>I can contact anyone through Facebook.</strong>\r\nThis is my fault, for being lazy and not bother to get people''s other contact information. Once I realized this, I spent some time getting other contact information from my Facebook friends and adding it to my address book. In the process I''ve realized that it''s never a good idea to trust one company with your contacts. Facebook has that stuff locked down, and it took a lot of work to get my information out. I used Google Contacts to export my address book to a open CSV file that I can store on my own computer.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Facebook is how other people share photos with me.</strong>\r\nThis was my original excuse for not quitting Facebook years ago. Facebook is a really convenient place to share photos with friends and family, and for them to share photos with you. There are definitely other options for photo sharing, and though they may not be convenient, maybe sharing less photos online will mean more opportunities to sit down side by side with someone and share photos. I think I''ve also got a narcissistic desire to see the photos that others have taken of me. I''ll miss that, but it''s probably a healthy thing to lose.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>You never know when you''ll need your Facebook network.</strong>\r\nFacebook has allowed people to take advantage of their relational networks in amazing ways. A few months ago, <a href="http://caminandoporfe--jandcinthedr.blogspot.com/">a friend of mine</a> was able to raise tens of thousands of dollars overnight to save the life of his newborn daughter, and his Facebook connections played a large part in that effort. While stories like that are really moving examples of the power that a social network can have, the real human connections that made that happen exist apart from Facebook. If something happens that my network needs to know about, it will be shared by those people on whatever websites they spend their time on. It doesn''t necessarily have to be Facebook, and the number of human connections that I have with others will never be determined by a friend or follower count.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Facebook is how person X communicates.</strong>\r\nMany of my Facebook friends are students that I''ve worked with as an RA, doing urban youth ministry, and working at a school in the Dominican Republic. Facebook is the primary way that many of them communicate online - they don''t use email, Twitter, etc. A friend of mine suggested that the reason he doesn''t quit Facebook is because we wants to be able to connect with those students "on their level". I think we need mentors who are willing to connect with people wherever they are. I deeply respect those that have made the decision to be on Facebook for that reason, and I wouldn''t argue with them to change. But my perspective is that very few people connect with others on Facebook exclusively, and many students on Facebook are there to connect with their friends, not their mentors.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThe real question is not whether to quit Facebook, but which medium will allow me to best connect and build relationships with the people I am trying to reach?\r\n<h2>How Do I Quit Facebook?</h2>\r\nIf this post has got you thinking about how you can quit Facebook, You can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account">permanently delete your Facebook account here</a>. That requires you to wait for two whole weeks and be careful to to use any website that you signed up for with Facebook. That''s plenty of time to second guess your decision. If you want a little bit more control over your information being deleted, <a href="http://www.suicidemachine.org/">you can try this tool</a>, but Facebook is trying to block it, so it might not work. Personally, I used <a href="http://allfacebook.com/the-facebook-platform-kill-switch-what-it-means_b14673">the Facebook Platform kill switch</a>, spent a couple of weeks reaching out to people letting them know that I was planning to quit, used the official form to close down my account, and then blocked Facebook <a href="http://www.guidingtech.com/4868/edit-hosts-file-block-websites/">using my hosts file</a> for two weeks.', 'I''m Quitting Facebook', '', 'draft', 'open', 'open', '', 'quitting-facebook', '', 'http://doulosdiscovery.org/about/our-staff/josiah-sprague/\nhttp://allfacebook.com/the-facebook-platform-kill-switch-what-it-means_b14673\nhttp://www.guidingtech.com/4868/edit-hosts-file-block-websites/', '2014-03-02 19:43:47', '2014-03-02 19:43:47', '', 0, 'http://josiahsprague.com/?p=372', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Packing up my life in Ohio, saying my goodbyes, arriving in Jarabacoa and trying to get my bearings in a new country and culture has been challenging and exciting.

Danae and I went to high school together at CVCA, and I am so blessed to be working with her and her husband Dan for the next three years. Dan will be the Expedition Coordinator at Doulos, and Danae will be the Instructional Coach for our teaching staff. Anginette went to CVCA as well, and just graduated this year. She will be at Doulos for the next semester to kick off her college career with Moody Bible Institute.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/a653d9c2df0611e1b62322000a1e8a75_7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-25" title="a653d9c2df0611e1b62322000a1e8a75_7" src="http://josiahsprague.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/a653d9c2df0611e1b62322000a1e8a75_7-300x300.jpg" alt="Guard tower in the parking lot." width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nOur flight was extremely smooth, and once we touched down in Santiago, we met with Tim, the Managing Director of Doulos, who drove us into Jarabacoa. On the way, we stopped to get groceries for dinner at La Sirena (the mermaid), which is more or less the Dominican version of WalMart. Parking lot security is taken very seriously here, and they have watchmen in towers to guard the cars.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/a8252022dc3f11e1979222000a1e8aa2_7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-26" title="a8252022dc3f11e1979222000a1e8aa2_7" src="http://josiahsprague.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/a8252022dc3f11e1979222000a1e8aa2_7-300x300.jpg" alt="Jarabacoa" width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nThis is Jarabacoa, our new home, seen from the mountains. You may be surprised, as I was, that pine trees are very common in the Dominican Republic. Another thing that is very common are the mosquitoes. Our first couple of days here, they couldn''t get enough of our fresh, North American blood. Insects are and lizards are the largest wild animals here. The scariest wildlife I''ve seen so far is a praying mantis, which is more amazing than scary.

A few of us spent a few hours shoveling gravel, for which our bodies are still punishing us, and I got to spend a lot of time carving wooden signs for some new classrooms. Building things with my hands was a nice change from a 9 to 5 office environment.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/50c3fefadde511e19fb4123138101461_7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-29" title="50c3fefadde511e19fb4123138101461_7" src="http://josiahsprague.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/50c3fefadde511e19fb4123138101461_7-300x300.jpg" alt="Carving signs for the new Doulos classrooms." width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nThere are other changes from my usual routine that have been a little harder to adjust to, such as how laundry is done here. Some people have fully automatic laundry, as in the states, but it is very common here to do laundry with a semi-automatic washer, and then dry it on the line. It takes more time and patience, and it''s not so compatible with my usual procrastination when it comes to laundry. Over time I think I will get used to it and value the extra time to think and pray.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/b77be87cdc1611e194a422000a1e8aa6_7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-30" title="b77be87cdc1611e194a422000a1e8aa6_7" src="http://josiahsprague.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/b77be87cdc1611e194a422000a1e8aa6_7-300x300.jpg" alt="Air drying laundry takes a long time." width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nThere have been both blessings and challenges so far, but by far the best moments I have had in the last few weeks were those of fellowship and worship. In a culture where I feel lost 95% of the time, it is an absolutely amazing sensation of solidarity to realize that we know the same loving father that takes care of all of our needs.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ecebb50cda3911e1aeb3123138150f49_7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-31" title="ecebb50cda3911e1aeb3123138150f49_7" src="http://josiahsprague.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ecebb50cda3911e1aeb3123138150f49_7-300x300.jpg" alt="Bi-cultural worship." width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe very though of His love brings rest in a time and place where everything takes intentional effort for me. But I am tired, if you''re one for praying, pray that I would spend more time resting in His love, seeking His presence and listening to and trusting His voice. I have worries, like whether I will be able to communicate well in Spanish, whether I will build strong relationships here, whether all of the support that I need will come in, and whether or not I will excel at my job here.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I spend much less time trusting God than I should. But I am thankful that I am here, with all of my familiar surroundings and comfortable retreats removed, where God''s love is the only comfort that I know. It brings to mind a quote that my Grandma loves to remind me of;\r\n<blockquote>Even youths grow weary and tired,\r\nAnd vigorous young men stumble badly,\r\n\r\nYet those who wait for the LORD\r\nWill gain new strength;\r\nThey will mount up <em>with </em>wings like eagles,\r\nThey will run and not get tired,\r\nThey will walk and not become weary.</blockquote>\r\nThank you for your prayers and support!

My first couple of weeks here, I lived with a host family who were very generous and welcoming as I began my transition to living in Dominican culture. Living in this new house is allowing me to transition more into life and experiences here.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_164" align="alignnone" width="300"]<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/4bd7337c16ce11e291a022000a1e8839_7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-164" title="My House" alt="My House" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/4bd7337c16ce11e291a022000a1e8839_7-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a> I live in the house on the left with a red roof.[/caption]\r\n\r\nOne of the things that I am excited about living in my own apartment is the ability to host friends. It is common in Dominican culture to gather at friends'' houses, rather than going out together. Without having my own place where I could host friends, I felt that it was difficult to initiate or reciprocate friendships with Dominicans, but now, thankfully, I have that ability.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_165" align="alignnone" width="300"]<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ae6bd4d80a6811e29f481231380fd1fd_7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-165" title="Hanging out on the Porch" alt="Hanging out on the Porch" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ae6bd4d80a6811e29f481231380fd1fd_7-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a> Singing and playing guitar on my porch with Dominican and German friends.[/caption]\r\n\r\nHaving friends over to my house has given me more opportunities to learn Spanish, which is something I absolutely enjoy doing, and allowed me to experience Latin America''s famous dancing talent (and Gringos'' comparative lack of dancing talent) first hand. If you''re wondering why I''m not in this picture, you''ve obviously never seen me try to dance.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_166" align="alignnone" width="300"]<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/6b5099c40aa711e299b11231381b6f02_7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-166" title="Friends Dancing" alt="Friends Dancing" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/6b5099c40aa711e299b11231381b6f02_7-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a> My friends Steph and Natali dancing in my house.[/caption]\r\n\r\nI''ve also been able to take my experience with Dominican cuisine to the next level, now that I have my own kitchen in which to cook. I''ve learned how to cook yuca frita, salami, queso frito and tostones (all Dominican favorites) and I''ve discovered, surprisingly, that though they live in a country full of cheap avocados, most Dominicans have never heard of guacamole.

Though the streets are a little rough, it always provides a little bit of entertainment with the reactions I get from people on the street. This week, on my way home, a motorcycle taxi driver asked if he could try my longboard. He quickly attracted a crowd of people, and though he swore he knew what he was doing, I don''t think he ever rode a longboard before.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_168" align="alignnone" width="300"]<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/23672d5414ab11e2bf8b22000a1e8b2b_7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-168" title="Concho Driver on Longboard" alt="Concho Driver on Longboard" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/23672d5414ab11e2bf8b22000a1e8b2b_7-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a> A taxi driver on my longboard.[/caption]\r\n\r\nSo, the longer commute isn''t so bad.

(271, 1, '2013-01-23 18:15:56', '2013-01-23 18:15:56', 'Lately I''ve had time to dig into a lot of books on my Kindle. I really enjoy the time I spend exploring the ideas of great authors. This week I finished reading a book called "<a href="http://amzn.to/10ISPyn">What''s Wrong with the World</a>" which got me thinking a lot about what I can do to benefit the small slice of the world that I have the opportunity to interact with.\n\nA chapter in the book that really grabbed my attention was about <a title="Innovative approach to education that I dig. Unrelated to the post at hand." href="http://doulosdiscovery.org/why-expeditionary-learning/">what it means to educate</a> others, and how clearly establishing our own personal beliefs is essential to educating others with a clear conscience. Teaching others, especially children, is not something to be taken lightly. The book says "Education is violent... it is what all human action is; it is an interference with life and growth." In light of the influence I have on others, my usual habit of carelessly sharing with others what "I think" or what "I feel" is irresponsible.\n\nThis got me thinking (like a huge nerd) about clarifying my own beliefs about the world, and establishing my own creed (or statement of what I believe to be true), before I dare to influence others. As I''ve begun evaluating and clarifying my beliefs, I was asking myself; "What do I accept as the core of reality?"\n\nThere are a lot of reasons behind my conclusion that I won''t take the time to go into here, but as I was thinking about the question, I came across a line in another book, "<a href="http://amzn.to/148H7Mp">Common Prayer: A Liturgy for Ordinary Radicals</a>" that describes one key aspect of the answer;\n<blockquote>God has "lived in community" from eternity as Father, Son and Holy Spirit. God as Trinity is the core reality of the universe, and that means that <em>the core of reality is community</em>.</blockquote>\n<strong>The core of reality <a href="http://emmausroadaustralia.blogspot.com/2007/11/relational-god.html">has to do with relationships</a>.

(161, 1, '2012-10-15 14:22:28', '2012-10-15 14:22:28', 'A few weeks ago, I moved into a new house in Jarabacoa with two other roommates. My first couple of weeks here, I lived with a host family who were very generous and welcoming as I began my transition to living in Dominican culture. Living in this new house is allowing me to transition more into life and experiences here.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/4bd7337c16ce11e291a022000a1e8839_7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-164" title="My House" alt="My House" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/4bd7337c16ce11e291a022000a1e8839_7-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne of the things that I am excited about living in my own apartment is the ability to host friends. It is common in Dominican culture to gather at friends'' houses, rather than going out together. Without having my own place where I could host friends, I felt that it was difficult to initiate or reciprocate friendships with Dominicans, but now, thankfully, I have that ability.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ae6bd4d80a6811e29f481231380fd1fd_7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-165" title="Hanging out on the Porch" alt="Hanging out on the Porch" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ae6bd4d80a6811e29f481231380fd1fd_7-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nHaving friends over to my house has given me more opportunities to learn Spanish, which is something I absolutely enjoy doing, and allowed me to experience Latin America''s famous dancing talent (and Gringos'' comparative lack of dancing talent) first hand. If you''re wondering why I''m not in this picture, you''ve obviously never seen me try to dance.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/6b5099c40aa711e299b11231381b6f02_7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-166" title="Friends Dancing" alt="Friends Dancing" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/6b5099c40aa711e299b11231381b6f02_7-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nI''ve also been able to take my experience with Dominican cuisine to the next level, now that I have my own kitchen in which to cook. I''ve learned how to cook yuca frita, salami, queso frito and tostones (all Dominican favorites) and I''ve discovered, surprisingly, that though they live in a country full of cheap avocados, most Dominicans have never heard of guacamole. Here, apparently, it''s a gringo thing.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/a4c42bc60e7611e2b52912313820446d_7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-169" title="Burnt Tostones" alt="Burnt Tostones" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/a4c42bc60e7611e2b52912313820446d_7-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne of the downsides of living in a new place is that it is farther from where I work, and I haven''t been <a title="My October Financial Needs Update" href="http://eepurl.com/pBzW9">able to afford a motorcycle</a> yet. The neighbor girls offered to let me use their "carro", but it''s not exactly my style.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1b4a04600e8f11e286fe22000a1de753_7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-167" title="Neighbors" alt="Neighbors" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1b4a04600e8f11e286fe22000a1de753_7-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nI''ve been using my longboard to get to work. Though the streets are a little rough, it always provides a little bit of entertainment with the reactions I get from people on the street. This week, on my way home, a motorcycle taxi driver asked if he could try my longboard. He quickly attracted a crowd of people, and though he swore he knew what he was doing, I don''t think he ever rode a longboard before.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/23672d5414ab11e2bf8b22000a1e8b2b_7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-168" title="Concho Driver on Longboard" alt="Concho Driver on Longboard" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/23672d5414ab11e2bf8b22000a1e8b2b_7-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nSo, the longer commute isn''t so bad. It''s also allowed me to explore more of Jarabacoa. I found that Batman apparently has a vacation home here.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/f0145726085011e29035123138140023_7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-170" title="Batmans House" alt="Batmans House" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/f0145726085011e29035123138140023_7-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nAnd when I finally get home from work, I can relax on my porch and enjoy the view. I definitely miss the beautiful fall weather in Ohio, but this view can definitely compete.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/63671cdc13ea11e29a5322000a1d0353_7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-163" title="Magote from Jarabacoa" alt="Magote from Jarabacoa" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/63671cdc13ea11e29a5322000a1d0353_7-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>', 'Moving into a new Neighborhood', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'new-neighborhood', '', '', '2014-03-03 00:29:58', '2014-03-03 00:29:58', '', 0, 'http://josiahsprague.com/blog/?p=161', 0, 'post', '', 1),

He quickly attracted a crowd of people, and though he swore he knew what he was doing, I don''t think he ever rode a longboard before.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_168" align="alignnone" width="300"]<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/23672d5414ab11e2bf8b22000a1e8b2b_7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-168" title="Concho Driver on Longboard" src="http://josiahsprague.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/23672d5414ab11e2bf8b22000a1e8b2b_7-300x300.jpg" alt="Concho Driver on Longboard" width="300" height="300" /></a> A taxi driver on my longboard.[/caption]\r\n\r\nSo, the longer commute isn''t so bad.

(706, 1, '2014-03-03 00:29:58', '2014-03-03 00:29:58', 'A few weeks ago, I moved into a new house in Jarabacoa with two other roommates. My first couple of weeks here, I lived with a host family who were very generous and welcoming as I began my transition to living in Dominican culture. Living in this new house is allowing me to transition more into life and experiences here.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/4bd7337c16ce11e291a022000a1e8839_7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-164" title="My House" alt="My House" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/4bd7337c16ce11e291a022000a1e8839_7-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne of the things that I am excited about living in my own apartment is the ability to host friends. It is common in Dominican culture to gather at friends'' houses, rather than going out together. Without having my own place where I could host friends, I felt that it was difficult to initiate or reciprocate friendships with Dominicans, but now, thankfully, I have that ability.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ae6bd4d80a6811e29f481231380fd1fd_7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-165" title="Hanging out on the Porch" alt="Hanging out on the Porch" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ae6bd4d80a6811e29f481231380fd1fd_7-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nHaving friends over to my house has given me more opportunities to learn Spanish, which is something I absolutely enjoy doing, and allowed me to experience Latin America''s famous dancing talent (and Gringos'' comparative lack of dancing talent) first hand. If you''re wondering why I''m not in this picture, you''ve obviously never seen me try to dance.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/6b5099c40aa711e299b11231381b6f02_7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-166" title="Friends Dancing" alt="Friends Dancing" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/6b5099c40aa711e299b11231381b6f02_7-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nI''ve also been able to take my experience with Dominican cuisine to the next level, now that I have my own kitchen in which to cook. I''ve learned how to cook yuca frita, salami, queso frito and tostones (all Dominican favorites) and I''ve discovered, surprisingly, that though they live in a country full of cheap avocados, most Dominicans have never heard of guacamole. Here, apparently, it''s a gringo thing.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/a4c42bc60e7611e2b52912313820446d_7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-169" title="Burnt Tostones" alt="Burnt Tostones" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/a4c42bc60e7611e2b52912313820446d_7-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nOne of the downsides of living in a new place is that it is farther from where I work, and I haven''t been <a title="My October Financial Needs Update" href="http://eepurl.com/pBzW9">able to afford a motorcycle</a> yet. The neighbor girls offered to let me use their "carro", but it''s not exactly my style.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1b4a04600e8f11e286fe22000a1de753_7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-167" title="Neighbors" alt="Neighbors" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1b4a04600e8f11e286fe22000a1de753_7-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nI''ve been using my longboard to get to work. Though the streets are a little rough, it always provides a little bit of entertainment with the reactions I get from people on the street. This week, on my way home, a motorcycle taxi driver asked if he could try my longboard.

(180, 1, '2012-10-30 15:39:15', '2012-10-30 15:39:15', 'Last week I wrote about my realization that <a title="I Can’t Do This" href="http://josiahsprague.com/blog/i-cant-do-this/">I can''t do this</a>, that I''m at the end of my rope with living in a foreign culture and with living a good life. This is a very real heart-crisis for me, but I want to clarify to those of you who were concerned, I am not considering leaving Jarabacoa or Doulos. I am still convinced that this is where I am supposed to be right now.\r\n\r\nThe (mostly internal) trials that I am facing are painful, and I''d honestly like to avoid them, but they are <a title="Consider it pure joy whenever you encounter trials..." href="http://bible.us/100/jas.1.2-4.nasb">shaping me in a good way</a>, and in a way that I wouldn''t otherwise be shaped without them.\r\n\r\nWhen I read the Bible, I often notice that Jesus'' disciples, who had the privilege of being with Him in person, just didn''t get it. They didn''t understand who Jesus was, or what He was up to. I can relate to that. I''ve spent my entire life in close proximity to churches and religious institutions that are all centered around Jesus, and I can explain the simple truth of the Gospel in 50 different ways.

They were probably even a bit annoyed that he was sleeping instead of grabbing a pail or a rope and helping them to keep the boat from sinking.\r\n\r\nWhat happened next in the story is even harder to believe, but it explains exactly why this guy was able to sleep through the storm. The fishermen yelled at him to wake him up, "Dude, wake up! Don''t you care that this boat is sinking?!". The speaker woke up, and without saying a word to the fishermen, looked up at the sky and said, "Enough! Be calm!" and<em> the waves instantly stopped tossing, and the skies cleared up</em>. Then, he turned to the fishermen and said, "Why are you afraid? Don''t you know who controls the storms?".\r\n\r\nI''d imagine if any of us had experienced that, we would have been pretty freaked out. The fishermen, who were used to handling a boat on a stormy sea, were probably more freaked out by this guy than they were by the storm. I mean, <em>who IS this guy</em>?

I love how both platforms make it easy for people to share ideas and communicate openly and freely. I love that both serve as a sort of "public square" of the web and support discourse, democracy and free society.\r\n\r\nI''ve been inspired lately by the ways that some websites have integrated Twitter, and I wanted to bring the same kind of integration to WordPress and take it a step further; helping WordPress bloggers to spark discussions and discourse on Twitter and other social media sites with the powerful statements they are already making.\r\n\r\nSo, I made a WordPress plugin that does exactly that. The plugin was mostly inspired by two sources. The first was the toolbar on Medium.com that enables people to tweet or comment on the text they select. The second was <a href="http://storylineblog.com">Donald Miller''s Storyline blog</a>, where he''s been adding "(tweet this)" links to the end of powerful quotes. The plugin is called <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/quotable/">Quotable</a>, and it brings both of those ideas to WordPress.\r\n\r\nQuotable helps readers share your inspiring content in two ways; first, by highlighting the text that they like and clicking one button to share it on Twitter. Second, by adding a link to the bottom of all the block quotes in a post, that will instantly share it.\r\n<blockquote><p>Quotable helps your readers share inspiring quotes from your site and spark engaging dialogue.</p></blockquote>\r\nThe plugin really serves two crowds. The readers of WordPress blogs that have the Quotable plugin installed will be able to quickly and easily share quotes that they like, and the authors of WordPress blogs benefit from the increased sharing of their content.\r\n\r\nThe plugin is written in a way that enhances existing features of <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/">Yoast''s WordPress SEO plugin</a>. If a site uses that plugin to define Twitter accounts for the site and it''s authors, those accounts will be mentioned in the tweets created by Quotable, which will encourage new followers and create new readers.\r\n\r\nIf you manage a WordPress site, I''d love it if you <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/quotable/">give Quotable a try</a>.

Can you drive?”\r\n\r\nShoot. I don’t own a car. When I need to, I borrow my roommate’s CRV, but he left on his motorcycle a few hours earlier to go camping.

But she’s cute; better to ask forgiveness than permission, right?\r\n\r\nI show up early in the morning at the same time as a few more of her friends who are joining us in a four wheeler and a dune buggy. A few cousins, aunts, and a small child fill up the CRV. I can’t follow the rapid-fire Spanish conversation, but I catch “Vamos!” Let’s go!\r\n\r\nWe start off on the 45 minute drive through bumpy mountain roads. I’m trying to keep up with the two vehicles in front. How do Dominicans drive so fast on these roads?\r\n\r\nWe’re headed up the side of a mountain half way to the reservoir, when all of the sudden, the rattle of the CRV’s questionable suspension becomes a much more violent vibration and the car slides off to the side of the road and comes to a halt.\r\n\r\nI get out and take a look. Both front wheels are pointed inward. We’re not going anywhere. I learned the word for “tow truck” the day before.\r\n\r\n“Does anyone know a <em>grúa</em> we can call?”\r\n\r\nIt’s Sunday. All of the shops are closed. We’re going to be here for awhile.\r\n\r\nI sit down on the side of the road and start to feel bad about borrowing my roommates car without asking.

This is a very real heart-crisis for me, but I want to clarify to those of you who were concerned, I am not considering leaving Jarabacoa or Doulos. I am still convinced that this is where I am supposed to be right now.\r\n\r\nThe (mostly internal) trials that I am facing are painful, and I''d honestly like to avoid them, but they are <a title="Consider it pure joy whenever you encounter trials..." href="http://bible.us/100/jas.1.2-4.nasb">shaping me in a good way</a>, and in a way that I wouldn''t otherwise be shaped without them.\r\n\r\nWhen I read the Bible, I often notice that Jesus'' disciples, who had the privilege of being with Him in person, just didn''t get it. They didn''t understand who Jesus was, or what He was up to. I can relate to that. I''ve spent my entire life in close proximity to churches and religious institutions that are all centered around Jesus, and I can explain the simple truth of the Gospel in 50 different ways. But when it comes to my own salvation, it is still very much <a href="http://bible.us/100/php.2.12-13.nasb">a messy issue that I am working out daily</a>.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_181" align="alignnone" width="300"]<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ac3fec1221d311e2b3af22000a1fb856_7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-181" title="A Kitten at Doulos" src="http://josiahsprague.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ac3fec1221d311e2b3af22000a1fb856_7-300x300.jpg" alt="A Kitten at Doulos" width="300" height="300" /></a> At times I feel as helpless as this Kitten that we found in the workshop at Doulos.[/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_182" align="alignnone" width="300"]<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/0cede6c2205311e29f3f22000a1f978e_7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-182" title="Wildflower in Jarabacoa" src="http://josiahsprague.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/0cede6c2205311e29f3f22000a1f978e_7-300x300.jpg" alt="Wildflower in Jarabacoa" width="300" height="300" /></a> Even when we are helpless, God takes care of us. (Luke 12:27-28)[/caption]\r\n\r\nJust as the disciples, who were daily with Jesus in the flesh, I have no clue what Jesus is about.\r\n\r\n<strong>Sometimes I think Jesus is about living a well-rounded life.</strong>\r\n\r\nSo often in Christian communities we hold up people who have their life together; who are healthy, happy, wealthy and wise. At times, I feel envious when I am not exalted by others as being noble or strong or wise.\r\n\r\n<em>But Jesus is not about me having my life together. <a href="http://bible.us/100/1co.1.26-31.nasb">He is about using my weak, foolish, and sometimes despised self for His glory</a>.</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Sometimes I think Jesus is about having rewarding friendships.</strong>\r\n\r\nThe second greatest commandment, Jesus said, was to love your neighbor as yourself. I can''t envision a way to live out that truth without being a friend to my neighbor.  As an extrovert, I am very comfortable with the idea of being friends with everyone. I will almost never pass up an opportunity to be with friends.\r\n\r\n<em>But Jesus is not about me having an entertaining social life. <a href="http://bible.us/100/mat.5.46.nasb">He is about loving others even when they don''t love back</a>, and <a href="http://bible.us/100/mrk.1.35.nasb">He frequently separated Himself from His closest friends to spend time alone with God</a>.</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Sometimes I think Jesus is about being materially successful.</strong>\r\n\r\nCertainly working hard is a good thing, and a hard worker is worthy of his wages. I feel that if I work hard, I am entitled to a reward. I look forward to having a car (that works), and a house (with a big yard), and a lot of money to spend.\r\n\r\n<em> But Jesus isn''t about making bank. <a href="http://bible.us/100/mat.6.19-21.nasb">He said that where our money goes has a lot to do with where our heart is, and that we shouldn''t place too much value in physical stuff that won''t last</a>.</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Sometimes I think Jesus is about communicating well.</strong>\r\n\r\nA lot of the role models that I have are good communicators. C.S. Lewis was an amazing writer. Brian Kunkler is a great speaker. Jesus himself was pretty good at communication. I studied Communication in college and I often take pride in my ability to communicate well.\r\n\r\n<em>But Jesus isn''t about choosing people based on their ability to communicate cleverly. <a href="http://bible.us/100/exo.4.10.nasb">Moses could barely handle public speaking</a>, and <a href="http://bible.us/100/1co.2.1-4.nasb">Paul said that persuasive words don''t matter</a>.</em>\r\n\r\nLife in Jarabacoa is wrecking my ideas about what Jesus is about. My life is not as well rounded as I think it should be. But I am learning that God can use me anyway. My social life is not as strong as it was in the States, but I am learning that my relationship with God matters more than being accepted by others. I am not earning as much money as I want to be earning, but I am learning that the things I often value are an illusion. Sometimes I feel that the only things that are going smoothly are my work on the Doulos website, and my efforts to learn Spanish, but I am learning that those don''t earn me any more credit with God.\r\n\r\nI am learning that, just like His disciples, I have no clue what Jesus is about. But He is teaching me and changing me on a daily basis. I am joyful in the struggles I am facing, knowing that they are drawing my closer to Jesus and turning me into <a href="http://bible.us/100/jas.1.4.nasb">a person who has everything</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'I Have No Clue What Jesus Is About', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '180-revision-4', '', '', '2012-10-30 15:56:29', '2012-10-30 15:56:29', '', 180, 'http://josiahsprague.com/180-revision-4/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(775, 1, '2014-04-04 20:43:07', '2014-04-04 20:43:07', '<h2>Do One Thing Really Well</h2>\r\nLately, it seems like there is never enough time in the day to do all the things on my plate. Between producing media for Doulos, teaching class, blogging, translating, attending study groups, making websites, building a small business on the side and trying to keep my education up to date, I do a lot of things. But lately I''ve been dissatisfied; My work is mediocre by my own standards and I''m not accomplishing things that are meaningful to me.\r\n\r\nI want to do better work. I want to do more meaningful things. I want to use my talents more fully. I want to love people better and build deeper relationships. I want to have time to reflect on what I''m doing. I want to use the one life that I have to its maximum potential.\r\n\r\nI need to focus my energy on doing one thing really well rather doing many things with mediocrity. After spending time reflecting on my values and passions, I''ve clarified my personal vocation, my "one thing", as the following;\r\n<blockquote>Helping individuals and organizations <a href="http://bible.com/100/gal.5.13-14.nasb">serve one another</a> via the web.</blockquote>\r\nMy current challenge is bring all the aspects of my life keenly into focus on that vocation, and to gracefully say "no" to anything that doesn''t contribute to it. Rather than focus on the negatives of the things that are distracting me from my vocation, the rest of this post is a glimpse of the positive ways that I am beginning to focus all of my time and energy towards it.\r\n\r\nI envision helping people and organizations serve one another in two ways. The first is through <strong>craftsmanship</strong>, and the second is through <strong>apprenticeship</strong>.\r\n<h2>Craftsmanship</h2>\r\n<em>Craftsmanship means using one''s gifts and talents to skillfully create high quality work and design.</em> My vision is to form a business that will craft high quality websites for a variety of clients and help them cultivate a valuable web presence that will help them serve their target audience.\r\n\r\nI have already established a small base of six initial clients for this company. And while I am very familiar with my craft, I have a lot to learn about running a business, so I am working with <a href="http://www.fourthwater.org/">Fourth Water</a>, a local business accelerator in Jarabacoa, and developing a formal business plan.\r\n<h2>Apprenticeship</h2>\r\nThe word "apprenticeship" is related to the Spanish word "aprender" (to learn) and<em> it means learning via practical experience from a skilled professional.</em> I believe that apprenticeship is vital to quality work and craftsmanship, and that professionals must constantly be apprentices as well as mentors. My vision is that my role as a  professional would become more and more aligned with my role as a teacher.\r\n\r\nThis past semester I had the opportunity to teach an elective communication class at Doulos. This coming semester, inspired by my passion for craftsmanship on the web and by students requesting to learn computer programming, I am developing plans to teach <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/cs">a programming elective</a> for high school and a <a href="http://codeclubworld.org/">code club</a> for elementary school. My long term vision is to be able to connect these students with opportunities to learn and develop their skills via hands on experiences with the business that I am forming.\r\n<h2>A Work in Progress</h2>\r\nThe specifics of this vision are still forming, and there is a long way to go. My desire is that they will continue to become clearer and more focused and that the end result will be a fruitful investment of my time and talents. I will continue to post updates here as things evolve, and I expect to spend a lot of time over the holidays developing and refining a plan.', 'Focusing My Vision', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '548-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-04-04 20:43:07', '2014-04-04 20:43:07', '', 548, 'http://josiahsprague.com/548-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

I had been spending the past several years settling into normal, post-college adult life, and I was beginning to get comfortable. I had an enjoyable job developing websites for a laid back eCommerce web development agency, and I envisioned myself living and working in northeast Ohio for the next several years.But alas, I didn''t know everything that was in store for me. In April, a coworker mentioned to me that he was taking a team of people to <a title="Expeditionary Learning Education in the Dominican Republic" href="http://doulosdiscovery.org/">Doulos Discovery School</a> in Jarabacoa for a week-long <a title="Missions Trip in the Dominican Republic" href="http://doulosdiscovery.org/opportunities/service-learning-trips/">Service Learning Trip</a>. The idea didn''t appeal to me, since I have had bad experiences with short term service trips in the past. But he continued to invite me and I decided, at the last minute, that the trip was a better way to spend my vacation time than any of the other ideas I had in mind.\r\n\r\nLittle did I know the huge impact that such a small decision would have on my life. (Take note; little decisions do matter.) Less than three full months later, I found myself leaving my comfortable, normal life in northeast Ohio to work full time at Doulos as their Media Coordinator. It feels a little bit crazy. There are a lot of challenges, and a lot of unknowns. But when I was presented with the opportunity, I couldn''t be content with the idea of turning it down.\r\n\r\nIt is as if I had been anticipating this opportunity my whole life, not knowing what it was until it was presented to me. The opportunity to communicate a story that I believe in, using tools with which I am trained and experienced, resonates with my soul. It is a story that I want to tell and a story in which I want to play a part.\r\n\r\nMy role at Doulos is to tell <a title="Founding Story of Doulos Discovery School" href="http://doulosdiscovery.org/about/founding-story/">the story of the school</a>—ultimately the story of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_news_(Christianity)">the Gospel</a>—using web and video media. I will be working to help Doulos create a bilingual, responsive website, which will help Doulos communicate with students, parents, community members and supporters. I will be creating videos to promote Doulos on the web and on local cable television, and I will help students and teachers communicate their stories to their sponsors.\r\n\r\nI also hope to immerse myself in Dominican culture, explore the country along with students on their <a title="Official Website of Expeditionary Learning Schools" href="http://elschools.org/">Expeditionary Learning</a> adventures and stay open to the unknown and unexpected. I expect life here to be full of ups and downs and adventures. I am all in and eager to see what God does with my life here.\r\n\r\nI welcome you to join me on this journey, please take a minute to <a href="http://eepurl.com/pbwzz">subscribe to my newsletter</a> and please email me at <a href="mailto:josiah.sprague@gmail.com">josiah.sprague@gmail.com</a> if you have any questions about how you can be a part.

(292, 1, '2013-03-04 17:08:26', '2013-03-04 17:08:26', 'Lately I''ve been feeling discouraged, feeling like its impossible to stay in the loop about what is happening at Doulos, so that I can do <a href="http://josiahsprague.com">my job of telling the story of the school</a>. Some of it touches on personal insecurity and fears of not being included by others, and other parts of it stem from finding too much of my identity in work. In other words, it''s been a deep soul-level discouragement.\r\n\r\nMy roommate, Eric, has also been discouraged, after a string of frustrating events with his job at <a href="http://www.sidominicanrepublic.com/dr/">Students International</a> and with <a href="http://josiahsprague.com/thank-god-that-he-is-justice/">our housing situation</a>. So both of us decided that this weekend would be a good time to escape to the beach for a day for some R&amp;R. We may have been more rested and recovered without it.\r\n\r\nAs <a href="http://josiahsprague.com/thank-god-that-he-is-justice/">I should have learned by now</a>, Eric''s car is not so reliable. About half way to the beach, on our way up a mountain, the car started to overheat. We stopped for awhile, opened the hood to check things out, and let the car cool down. While we waited, Eric told me how the radiator had exploded for the previous owner, splattering boiling coolant fluid all over the hood and windshield. We both agreed it would be good to take it easy driving up the mountains.\r\n\r\nOnce the car was cooled down and we were ready to get back on the road, we found that the hood wouldn''t latch securely. As we were trying to fix the latch, a Dominican driving by on his motorcycle stopped and helped us tie down the hood with a rubber strap. Definitely a hack, but it seemed like it would hold and soon we were back on our way, driving slowly up the mountain.\r\n\r\nOnce we were over the mountain, and coming back down the other side, we were able to drive faster again, since the engine wasn''t being pushed so hard and the airflow was keeping things cool. We were cruising along, happily approaching the beach at 50mph when suddenly, BOOM! The hood of the car flew up, shattering the windshield in our faces and blocking our vision! Thankfully, no glass actually cut our faces or got in our eyes, and we were on a straight road and Eric was able to safely stop the car before we hit anything or ended up off-road in a huge ditch or down the side of a mountain.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://instagram.com/p/WYGSfuTUSk/"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-296" alt="windshield" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/windshield-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nThough public infrastructure and assistance isn''t so common, Dominicans are very eager to help a stranger. Within 30 seconds, another Dominican stopped to help. He was the manager of <a href="http://www.bahia-principe.com/en/">a garage about five minutes away</a>, so he helped us get the car there, where they removed the windshield and used an air compressor to blow all of the glass fragments off of the dashboard and seats. A couple of hours later, we were back on our way to the beach.\r\n\r\nWe had left at 9:30 in the morning to go to a beach less than two hours away. By the time we got there, it was 3:30 in the afternoon. We got to swim in a <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/KJy7h">beautiful crystal clear ocean</a>, and read in our <a href="http://www.socohammocks.com/">SoCo Hammocks</a> for a few hours. We had a nice Dominican-style dinner, and then drove three hours slowly back to Jarabacoa without a windshield, and nervously watching the temperature gauge to make sure that the radiator wouldn''t overheat and explode.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://instagram.com/p/WZe3GgzUS8/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-297" alt="Dominican Food" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dominican-food-presidente-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nNeither of us has any idea why we''ve experienced such a string of crazy events.

Long story short, the justice system in the DR is nowhere near as respected as that in the States, and we have to move out of the house.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/c4d6d11879db11e2a9de22000a1f92c9_7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-287 alignnone" alt="Not My New House" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/c4d6d11879db11e2a9de22000a1f92c9_7-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>I am thankful that God''s justice is far above any human justice system. <strong>Our earthly dwelling is insecure, but our home with God is eternally secure.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYesterday I attempted to drive to visit a Reservoir an hour away in Santiago, but the car I borrowed broke down in the middle of nowhere (on a Sunday, with only Spanish-speakers around). We were able to get a tow truck, and I was amazed at the unruffled attitude of the Dominicans. A few months ago, with an American mindset, I would have been angry.

This week I finished reading a book called "<a href="http://amzn.to/10ISPyn">What''s Wrong with the World</a>" which got me thinking a lot about what I can do to benefit the small slice of the world that I have the opportunity to interact with.\r\n\r\nA chapter in the book that really grabbed my attention was about <a title="Innovative approach to education that I dig. Unrelated to the post at hand." href="http://doulosdiscovery.org/why-expeditionary-learning/">what it means to educate</a> others, and how clearly establishing our own personal beliefs is essential to educating others with a clear conscience. Teaching others, especially children, is not something to be taken lightly. The book says "Education is violent... it is what all human action is; it is an interference with life and growth." In light of the influence I have on others, my usual habit of carelessly sharing with others what "I think" or what "I feel" is irresponsible.\r\n\r\nThis got me thinking (like a huge nerd) about clarifying my own beliefs about the world, and establishing my own creed (or statement of what I believe to be true), before I dare to influence others. As I''ve begun evaluating and clarifying my beliefs, I was asking myself; "What do I accept as the core of reality?"\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of reasons behind my conclusion that I won''t take the time to go into here, but as I was thinking about the question, I came across a line in another book, "<a href="http://amzn.to/148H7Mp">Common Prayer: A Liturgy for Ordinary Radicals</a>" that describes one key aspect of the answer;\r\n<blockquote>God has "lived in community" from eternity as Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

Poverty takes on so many different forms that it is often hard to recognize what poverty really means. I''ve seen the poverty of the homeless man, who gets $10,000 a year begging on a street corner and spends it all on a heroine addiction. I''ve seen the poverty of a teenager who has a Playstation 3 and unlimited supply of Mountain Dew, but who has absent parents and struggles to succeed in school. And I''ve seen the poverty of a loving family who does everything together, but eats rice and beans and lives in a wooden shack next to a sewage filled river.\n\nI''ve struggled with trying to make sense of all of these different experiences. How can a poor child from a developing country who can''t even afford a computer do so much better in school than a kid who''s got access to high speed internet and a school full of educational technology? How can a family that lives in a tiny shack with a dirt floor be more satisfied with their lives than a man that makes $75,000 a year and drives a new sports car? How can we say we have poverty in America, when compared with the developing world, we don''t even know what it means to lack material resources? How can we say that the developing world is poor, when they''re among the happiest countries in the world?\n\nRecently, I''ve been reading <a href="http://amzn.to/XU6RYb">When Helping Hurts</a>, a book about helping the poor in a way that doesn''t do more harm than good. The book challenges the common idea that poverty means a lack of material resources. The book quotes several people talking about their own experience of being poor. They described how they felt using words like; shame, unwanted, uncomfortable, depressed, unhappy, alone, powerless, unheard, stuck.\n\nAs I read their definitions of poverty, I was struck by how much these words resonated with me; They are all things I have experienced first hand. While I was thinking about their words, someone said to me, "All of us are poor because we all have a disconnect from God". Boom. Everything suddenly clicked for me. <em>Poverty is not a lack of stuff. Poverty is a disconnect; a broken relationship with ourselves, with other people, with creation and with God.</em>\n<blockquote>"All of us are poor because we all have a disconnect from God"</blockquote>\nJesus said that <a href="https://www.youversion.com/bible/111/mat.26.11.niv">there will always be poor people in the world</a>. The word that is translated as poor in our Bible is the Greek word ptōchos (<a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G4434&amp;t=NASB">πτωχός</a>) which is also translated as broken, or lowly. We have all experienced poverty in one form or another. We have all felt broken. We all know what it feels like to be powerless and how much it hurts to be unwanted. But Jesus also said another interesting thing about ptōchos. In the beatitudes, he says "<a href="https://www.youversion.com/bible/111/mat.5.3.niv">Blessed are the ptōchos, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven</a>".\n\nJesus says that the broken, unwanted and powerless are not just permitted to be a part of his family, but they have actually been given part ownership of it. They''re no longer lacking wealth, but they''re shareholders in the most important business of the universe. They''re not alone, powerless or unheard, but connected, empowered, loved and valued. In our world, being poor is a curse, but in his world, in his kingdom, it is a blessing.\n\nWe know that poverty will always be with us, but Jesus also tells us, and we can tell others with our words and with our lives, that <em>poverty is not permanent</em>; our brokenness will be healed, and in fact, is already being healed. <em>We are all poor.</em> Because true poverty isn''t a lack of stuff, but broken relationships. <em>And we are all blessed.</em> Because the truth is that God''s kingdom has been given to us.\n\n<em>Poverty is a lie.</em> The truth is that <a href="http://vimeo.com/27096230">we are created in the image of God with dignity, worth and the ability to help ourselves and our families and our entire communities</a>.\n\n&nbsp;', 'What is Poverty?', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '300-revision-2', '', '', '2013-03-05 20:03:28', '2013-03-05 20:03:28', '', 300, 'http://josiahsprague.com/300-revision-2/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Some of it touches on personal insecurity and fears of not being included by others, and other parts of it stem from finding too much of my identity in work. In other words, it''s been a deep soul-level discouragement.\r\n\r\nMy roommate, Eric, has also been discouraged, after a string of frustrating events with his job at <a href="http://www.sidominicanrepublic.com/dr/">Students International</a> and with <a href="http://josiahsprague.com/thank-god-that-he-is-justice/">our housing situation</a>. So both of us decided that this weekend would be a good time to escape to the beach for a day for some R&amp;R. We may have been more rested and recovered without it.\r\n\r\nAs <a href="http://josiahsprague.com/thank-god-that-he-is-justice/">I should have learned by now</a>, Eric''s car is not so reliable. About half way to the beach, on our way up a mountain, the car started to overheat. We stopped for awhile, opened the hood to check things out, and let the car cool down. While we waited, Eric told me how the radiator had exploded for the previous owner, splattering boiling coolant fluid all over the hood and windshield. We both agreed it would be good to take it easy driving up the mountains.\r\n\r\nOnce the car was cooled down and we were ready to get back on the road, we found that the hood wouldn''t latch securely. As we were trying to fix the latch, a Dominican driving by on his motorcycle stopped and helped us tie down the hood with a rubber strap. Definitely a hack, but it seemed like it would hold and soon we were back on our way, driving slowly up the mountain.\r\n\r\nOnce we were over the mountain, and coming back down the other side, we were able to drive faster again, since the engine wasn''t being pushed so hard and the airflow was keeping things cool. We were cruising along, happily approaching the beach at 50mph when suddenly, BOOM! The hood of the car flew up, shattering the windshield in our faces and blocking our vision! Thankfully, no glass actually cut our faces or got in our eyes, and we were on a straight road and Eric was able to safely stop the car before we hit anything or ended up off-road in a huge ditch or down the side of a mountain.\r\n\r\nThough public infrastructure and assistance isn''t so common, Dominicans are very eager to help a stranger. Within 30 seconds, another Dominican stopped to help. He was the manager of <a href="http://www.bahia-principe.com/en/">a garage about five minutes away</a>, so he helped us get the car there, where they removed the windshield and used an air compressor to blow all of the glass fragments off of the dashboard and seats. A couple of hours later, we were back on our way to the beach.\r\n\r\nWe had left at 9:30 in the morning to go to a beach less than two hours away. By the time we got there, it was 3:30 in the afternoon. We got to swim in a <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/KJy7h">beautiful crystal clear ocean</a>, and read in our <a href="http://www.socohammocks.com/">SoCo Hammocks</a> for a few hours. We had a nice Dominican-style dinner, and then drove three hours slowly back to Jarabacoa without a windshield, and nervously watching the temperature gauge to make sure that the radiator wouldn''t overheat and explode.\r\n\r\nNeither of us has any idea why we''ve experienced such a string of crazy events. But we both agree that living in the Dominican Republic is teaching us to go with the flow and realize that not everything is always under our control, but that''s ok.

(303, 1, '2013-03-05 20:15:14', '2013-03-05 20:15:14', 'In the last several years I''ve witnessed poverty in many different forms and contexts ranging from poverty in urban areas of Akron, Ohio to poverty in rural areas of the Dominican Republic. Poverty takes on so many different forms that it is often hard to recognize what poverty really means. I''ve seen the poverty of the homeless man, who gets $10,000 a year begging on a street corner and spends it all on a heroine addiction. I''ve seen the poverty of a teenager who has a Playstation 3 and unlimited supply of Mountain Dew, but who has absent parents and struggles to succeed in school. And I''ve seen the poverty of a loving family who does everything together, but eats rice and beans and lives in a wooden shack next to a sewage filled river.\r\n\r\nI''ve struggled with trying to make sense of all of these different experiences. How can a poor child from a developing country who can''t even afford a computer do so much better in school than a kid who''s got access to high speed internet and a school full of educational technology? How can a family that lives in a tiny shack with a dirt floor be more satisfied with their lives than a man that makes $75,000 a year and drives a new sports car? How can we say we have poverty in America, when compared with the developing world, we don''t even know what it means to lack material resources? How can we say that the developing world is poor, when they''re among the happiest countries in the world?\r\n\r\nRecently, I''ve been reading <a href="http://amzn.to/XU6RYb">When Helping Hurts</a>, a book about helping the poor in a way that doesn''t do more harm than good. The book challenges the common idea that poverty means a lack of material resources. The book quotes several people talking about their own experience of being poor. They described how they felt using words like; shame, unwanted, uncomfortable, depressed, unhappy, alone, powerless, unheard, stuck.\r\n\r\nAs I read their definitions of poverty, I was struck by how much these words resonated with me; They are all things I have experienced first hand. While I was thinking about their words, someone said to me, "All of us are poor because we all have a disconnect from God". Boom. Everything suddenly clicked for me. <em>Poverty is not a lack of stuff. Poverty is a disconnect; a broken relationship with ourselves, with other people, with creation and with God.</em>\r\n<blockquote>"All of us are poor because we all have a disconnect from God"</blockquote>\r\nJesus said that <a href="https://www.youversion.com/bible/111/mat.26.11.niv">there will always be poor people in the world</a>. The word that is translated as poor in our Bible is the Greek word ptōchos (<a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G4434&amp;t=NASB">πτωχός</a>) which is also translated as broken, or lowly. We have all experienced poverty in one form or another. We have all felt broken. We all know what it feels like to be powerless and how much it hurts to be unwanted. But Jesus also said another interesting thing about ptōchos. In the beatitudes, he says "<a href="https://www.youversion.com/bible/111/mat.5.3.niv">Blessed are the ptōchos, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven</a>".\r\n\r\nJesus says that the broken, unwanted and powerless are not just permitted to be a part of his family, but they have actually been given part ownership of it. They''re no longer lacking wealth, but they''re shareholders in the most important business of the universe. They''re not alone, powerless or unheard, but connected, empowered, loved and valued. In our world, being poor is a curse, but in his world, in his kingdom, it is a blessing.\r\n\r\nWe know that poverty will always be with us, but Jesus also tells us, and we can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=546888691999750&amp;link=http://josiahsprague.com/what-is-poverty/&amp;name=Poverty%20Is%20Not%20Permanent&amp;caption=Poverty%20is%20a%20lie.%20The%20truth%20is%20that%20we%20are%20created%20in%20the%20image%20of%20God%20with%20dignity,%20worth%20and%20the%20ability%20to%20help%20ourselves%20and%20our%20families%20and%20our%20entire%20communities.&amp;redirect_uri=http://josiahsprague.com/what-is-poverty/">tell others</a> with our words and with our lives, that <em>poverty is not permanent</em>; our brokenness will be healed, and in fact, is already being healed. <em>We are all poor.</em> Because true poverty isn''t a lack of stuff, but broken relationships. <em>And we are all blessed.</em> Because the truth is that God''s kingdom has been given to us.\r\n\r\n<em>Poverty is a lie.</em> The truth is that <a href="http://vimeo.com/27096230">we are created in the image of God with dignity, worth and the ability to help ourselves and our families and our entire communities</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'What is Poverty?', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '300-revision-3', '', '', '2013-03-05 20:15:14', '2013-03-05 20:15:14', '', 300, 'http://josiahsprague.com/300-revision-3/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(313, 1, '2013-03-04 17:19:14', '2013-03-04 17:19:14', 'Lately I''ve been feeling discouraged, feeling like its impossible to stay in the loop about what is happening at Doulos, so that I can do <a href="http://josiahsprague.com">my job of telling the story of the school</a>. Some of it touches on personal insecurity and fears of not being included by others, and other parts of it stem from finding too much of my identity in work. In other words, it''s been a deep soul-level discouragement.\r\n\r\nMy roommate, Eric, has also been discouraged, after a string of frustrating events with his job at <a href="http://www.sidominicanrepublic.com/dr/">Students International</a> and with <a href="http://josiahsprague.com/thank-god-that-he-is-justice/">our housing situation</a>. So both of us decided that this weekend would be a good time to escape to the beach for a day for some R&amp;R. We may have been more rested and recovered without it.\r\n\r\nAs <a href="http://josiahsprague.com/thank-god-that-he-is-justice/">I should have learned by now</a>, Eric''s car is not so reliable. About half way to the beach, on our way up a mountain, the car started to overheat. We stopped for awhile, opened the hood to check things out, and let the car cool down. While we waited, Eric told me how the radiator had exploded for the previous owner, splattering boiling coolant fluid all over the hood and windshield. We both agreed it would be good to take it easy driving up the mountains.\r\n\r\nOnce the car was cooled down and we were ready to get back on the road, we found that the hood wouldn''t latch securely. As we were trying to fix the latch, a Dominican driving by on his motorcycle stopped and helped us tie down the hood with a rubber strap. Definitely a hack, but it seemed like it would hold and soon we were back on our way, driving slowly up the mountain.\r\n\r\nOnce we were over the mountain, and coming back down the other side, we were able to drive faster again, since the engine wasn''t being pushed so hard and the airflow was keeping things cool. We were cruising along, happily approaching the beach at 50mph when suddenly, BOOM! The hood of the car flew up, shattering the windshield in our faces and blocking our vision! Thankfully, no glass actually cut our faces or got in our eyes, and we were on a straight road and Eric was able to safely stop the car before we hit anything or ended up off-road in a huge ditch or down the side of a mountain.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://instagram.com/p/WYGSfuTUSk/"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-296" alt="windshield" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/windshield-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nThough public infrastructure and assistance isn''t so common, Dominicans are very eager to help a stranger. Within 30 seconds, another Dominican stopped to help. He was the manager of <a href="http://www.bahia-principe.com/en/">a garage about five minutes away</a>, so he helped us get the car there, where they removed the windshield and used an air compressor to blow all of the glass fragments off of the dashboard and seats.

My roommates and I moved into a new house, only to find out that there was a family conflict with the landlord which called into question who owns the house. Long story short, the justice system in the DR is nowhere near as respected as that in the States, and we have to move out of the house.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/c4d6d11879db11e2a9de22000a1f92c9_7.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-287 alignnone" alt="Not My New House" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/c4d6d11879db11e2a9de22000a1f92c9_7-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>I am thankful that God''s justice is far above any human justice system. <strong>Our earthly dwelling is insecure, but our home with God is eternally secure.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYesterday I attempted to drive to visit a Reservoir an hour away in Santiago, but the car I borrowed broke down in the middle of nowhere (on a Sunday, with only Spanish-speakers around). We were able to get a tow truck, and I was amazed at the unruffled attitude of the Dominicans. A few months ago, with an American mindset, I would have been angry. The experience was a good example for me that sometimes we allow unimportant things to bend us out of shape.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/towtruck.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-288 alignnone" alt="Tow Truck Experience" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/towtruck-300x154.jpg" width="300" height="154" /></a>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>I am thankful for frustrating days as well as smooth days</strong>, and reminded that thanking God and letting go of things that don''t really matter can turn big frustrations into "light and momentary trouble".</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nOverall, at an age in life where people are supposed to start having their world view figured out, mine is continually being wrecked.

(315, 1, '2013-03-25 17:13:49', '2013-03-25 17:13:49', 'Lately I''ve been feeling discouraged, feeling like its impossible to stay in the loop about what is happening at Doulos, so that I can do <a href="http://josiahsprague.com">my job of telling the story of the school</a>. Some of it touches on personal insecurity and fears of not being included by others, and other parts of it stem from finding too much of my identity in work. In other words, it''s been a deep soul-level discouragement.\r\n\r\nMy roommate, Eric, has also been discouraged, after a string of frustrating events with his job at <a href="http://www.sidominicanrepublic.com/dr/">Students International</a> and with <a href="http://josiahsprague.com/thank-god-that-he-is-justice/">our housing situation</a>. So both of us decided that this weekend would be a good time to escape to the beach for a day for some R&amp;R. We may have been more rested and recovered without it.\r\n\r\nAs <a href="http://josiahsprague.com/thank-god-that-he-is-justice/">I should have learned by now</a>, Eric''s car is not so reliable. About half way to the beach, on our way up a mountain, the car started to overheat. We stopped for awhile, opened the hood to check things out, and let the car cool down. While we waited, Eric told me how the radiator had exploded for the previous owner, splattering boiling coolant fluid all over the hood and windshield. We both agreed it would be good to take it easy driving up the mountains.\r\n\r\nOnce the car was cooled down and we were ready to get back on the road, we found that the hood wouldn''t latch securely. As we were trying to fix the latch, a Dominican driving by on his motorcycle stopped and helped us tie down the hood with a rubber strap. Definitely a hack, but it seemed like it would hold and soon we were back on our way, driving slowly up the mountain.\r\n\r\nOnce we were over the mountain, and coming back down the other side, we were able to drive faster again, since the engine wasn''t being pushed so hard and the airflow was keeping things cool. We were cruising along, happily approaching the beach at 50mph when suddenly, BOOM! The hood of the car flew up, shattering the windshield in our faces and blocking our vision! Thankfully, no glass actually cut our faces or got in our eyes, and we were on a straight road and Eric was able to safely stop the car before we hit anything or ended up off-road in a huge ditch or down the side of a mountain.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://instagram.com/p/WYGSfuTUSk/"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-296" alt="windshield" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/windshield-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nThough public infrastructure and assistance isn''t so common, Dominicans are very eager to help a stranger. Within 30 seconds, another Dominican stopped to help. He was the manager of <a href="http://www.bahia-principe.com/en/">a garage about five minutes away</a>, so he helped us get the car there, where they removed the windshield and used an air compressor to blow all of the glass fragments off of the dashboard and seats.

But yesterday I got a glimpse of it;\r\n\r\nOur love for one another is seen in the fact that we all came from different places, to do different things, without knowing each other beforehand and having very different ideas and theologies, but we''ve got a simple and powerful unity based on one thing; the love that Jesus had for us that motivates us and drives us in everything that we do.\r\n\r\nIt''s cool to be a part of the global community that even when we disagree or fight or have totally different ideas, we''re all united together in the application of the self-sacrificing love that Christ has shown to us.', 'An Unlikely Unity', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '275-revision-3', '', '', '2013-02-05 14:44:26', '2013-02-05 14:44:26', '', 275, 'http://josiahsprague.com/275-revision-3/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

This week I finished reading a book called "<a href="http://amzn.to/10ISPyn">What''s Wrong with the World</a>" which got me thinking a lot about what I can do to benefit the small slice of the world that I have the opportunity to interact with.\r\n\r\nA chapter in the book that really grabbed my attention was about <a title="Innovative approach to education that I dig. Unrelated to the post at hand." href="http://doulosdiscovery.org/why-expeditionary-learning/">what it means to educate</a> others, and how clearly establishing our own personal beliefs is essential to educating others with a clear conscience. Teaching others, especially children, is not something to be taken lightly. The book says "Education is violent... it is what all human action is; it is an interference with life and growth." In light of the influence I have on others, my usual habit of carelessly sharing with others what "I think" or what "I feel" is irresponsible.\r\n\r\nThis got me thinking (like a huge nerd) about clarifying my own beliefs about the world, and establishing my own creed (or statement of what I believe to be true), before I dare to influence others. As I''ve begun evaluating and clarifying my beliefs, I was asking myself; "What do I accept as the core of reality?"\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of reasons behind my conclusion that I won''t take the time to go into here, but as I was thinking about the question, I came across a line in another book, "<a href="http://amzn.to/148H7Mp">Common Prayer: A Liturgy for Ordinary Radicals</a>" that describes one key aspect of the answer;\r\n<blockquote>God has "lived in community" from eternity as Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

People see me as a "good person", "a missionary", "a volunteer". At times, that sort of identity is easy to embrace. After all, who doesn''t want to be seen as a good person? I enjoy believing that I''ve earned it, that I''m a good guy, that I do good work, and that I''m faithful. But the problem with that, is that <a href="https://www.youversion.com/bible/111/rom.3.10.niv"><em>it''s a lie</em></a>. When I''m honest with myself about the things that I''m tempted by, and the things that I''m capable of, I see how dark my heart really is.  I love this quote;\r\n<blockquote>My memory is nearly gone;\r\nbut I remember two things;\r\nThat I am a great sinner, and\r\nthat Christ is a great Saviour.\r\n<cite><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Newton">John Newton (1725-1807)</a></cite></blockquote>\r\nThese are my two greatest convictions in life. I hope that when I am old, and my memory begins to fade, or when I die and the memory of me begins to fade in my friends and family, that these truths remain.\r\n\r\n<strong>I am a great sinner.</strong> Over the holiday break I was faced with temptations that are uglier than I wish to describe publicly.

By the grace of God, I hope never to commit such terrible acts, but I know internally that I have no better moral standing than the people who have.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to the second truth;\r\n\r\n<strong>Christ is a great savior.</strong> As scandalous as this may be, Jesus had so much love for us dirty, broken humans that he devoted His entire life, <a href="http://bible.us/111/php.2.8.niv">even to the point of dying</a>, just to communicate this message; <em>that no matter how dirty we are, whatever awful thoughts we''ve entertained or whatever heinous crimes we''ve committed, God wants to bring us back into a relationship with Him.</em> A relationship where our guilt has been paid for, where we have no shame for any of our dirt or darkness, where He cleans us up and where our entire identity is summed up in the statement, "<a href="https://www.youversion.com/bible/111/gal.4.7.niv">You''re my child, and I love you no matter what!</a>"\r\n\r\nMaybe this is too spiritual for some of you. Too religious, too condemning, or too judgmental. For others, maybe it is too worldly  too sinful, or too immoral. <strong>But please hear this;</strong> <em>this is the core reason, in fact, the only reason, why I''m able to call myself a Christian and why I am working as "a missionary" at Doulos.</em> It''s not because I''m a good person. It''s not because I''m spiritual, or religious, or moral. <a href="https://www.youversion.com/bible/111/1ti.1.15.niv">The simple fact is that I''m not</a>. I''m a man with a dark and dirty heart. The <a href="https://www.youversion.com/bible/111/php.3.8.niv">only redeeming factor</a> of my life is Christ. His unconditional love for me, and His willingness to cover my shame and claim me no matter how dirty I am.\r\n\r\nMy life is lived in light of that.

Obviously some of these methods work better than others, and the best method is to <strong>keep a spare key</strong> in your wallet, behind your license plate, or at home, but here are some of the more reliable ways to open your car if you find yourself locked out;\n<ul>\n	<li> <strong>Call a dealership</strong> and request a replacement key. Most dealers can provide a replacement key for around five dollars. Just make sure you''re not paying the "programming fee" for newer cars, you just need the key to open the door, not start your car.</li>\n	<li><strong>Call roadside assistance</strong> such as <a href="http://www.aaa.com" target="_blank">AAA</a> or <a href="www.onstar.com" target="_blank">OnStar</a>. These companies can send out a reputable locksmith to help you and if you are a member, the service may be included in your membership.</li>\n	<li><strong>Call the police</strong> and ask if they can help. Many police will not open locked car doors because they do not want to be held responsible for possible damage to your car, but some police may still help so it''s worth a call. If a child or a pet is trapped in the car, police will help, call 911 if it is an emergency.</li>\n	<li><strong>Call a local locksmith</strong> if you can find a phone book, or if you live near Akron you can use Akron Locksmith''s 24/7 Emergency Service, just call (330) 375-5260.</li>\n	<li><strong>Use a coat hanger</strong> to unlock the door yourself. This is a time-tested method of opening a locked door. You risk damaging your door if you don''t <a title="How to Open a Locked Car with a Coat Hanger" href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4474240_unlock-car-coat-hanger.html" target="_blank">know what you are doing</a>, but if you are far away from any help, this may be your best option.</li>\n	<li><strong>Use a Slim Jim</strong> for older cars. If you happen to have access to a Slim Jim, this is one of the easiest ways to open a locked car door, however, it takes <a title="How to Open a Locked Car with a Slim Jim" href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4450109_break-car-slim-jim.html" target="_blank">a little know-how</a>, and some cars are Slim Jim proof.</li>\n	<li><strong>Use a rock, brick, or sledgehammer</strong> as a last resort if the matter is urgent. The glass can always be repaired, but please, at least count to three before you <a href="http://www.videogamesblogger.com/2009/06/19/red-faction-guerrilla-promotion-smashes-car-windows.htm" target="_blank">break anything</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n', 'Locked Out', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '129-revision', '', '', '2009-11-04 02:58:17', '2009-11-04 02:58:17', '', 129, 'http://josiahsprague.com/129-revision/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The word that is translated as poor in our Bible is the Greek word ptōchos (<a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G4434&amp;t=NASB">πτωχός</a>) which is also translated as broken, or lowly. We have all experienced poverty in one form or another. We have all felt broken. We all know what it feels like to be powerless and how much it hurts to be unwanted. But Jesus also said another interesting thing about ptōchos. In the beatitudes, he says "<a href="https://www.youversion.com/bible/111/mat.5.3.niv">Blessed are the ptōchos, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven</a>".\r\n\r\nJesus says that the broken, unwanted and powerless are not just permitted to be a part of his family, but they have actually been given part ownership of it. They''re no longer lacking wealth, but they''re shareholders in the most important business of the universe. They''re not alone, powerless or unheard, but connected, empowered, loved and valued. In our world, being poor is a curse, but in his world, in his kingdom, it is a blessing.\r\n\r\nWe know that poverty will always be with us, but Jesus also tells us, and we can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=546888691999750&amp;link=http://josiahsprague.com/what-is-poverty/&amp;name=Poverty%20Is%20Not%20Permanent&amp;caption=Poverty%20is%20a%20lie.%20The%20truth%20is%20that%20we%20are%20created%20in%20the%20image%20of%20God%20with%20dignity,%20worth%20and%20the%20ability%20to%20help%20ourselves%20and%20our%20families%20and%20our%20entire%20communities.&amp;redirect_uri=http://josiahsprague.com/what-is-poverty/">tell others</a> with our words and with our lives, that <em>poverty is not permanent</em>; our brokenness will be healed, and in fact, is already being healed. <em>We are all poor.</em> Because true poverty isn''t a lack of stuff, but broken relationships. <em>And we are all blessed.</em> Because the truth is that God''s kingdom has been given to us.\r\n\r\n<em>Poverty is a lie.</em> The truth is that <a href="http://vimeo.com/27096230">we are created in the image of God with dignity, worth and the ability to help ourselves, our families and our entire communities</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'What is Poverty?', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '300-revision-8', '', '', '2013-03-25 17:26:54', '2013-03-25 17:26:54', '', 300, 'http://josiahsprague.com/300-revision-8/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(404, 1, '2013-05-01 16:04:29', '2013-05-01 16:04:29', '<p>My list of reasons to quit Facebook has been slowly growing, but Facebook''s useful features have kept me hanging on until now. A few weeks ago I watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voWvqBsyYbE">an advertisement for Facebook Home</a> that put the final nail in the coffin.</p>\n\n<p>The video portrays a girl, about my age, apparently bored at a family gathering. She does what has become an infamous habit in our world; she pulls out her phone for something more entertaining.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that she is more interested in her phone than in the people around her isn''t shocking. We see this happen every day. I even see it here in the Dominican Republic. The thing that is shocking is the extent to which Facebook is celebrating and encouraging the habit. It''s offensive.</p>\n\n<p>The girl in the video is the antithesis of who I want to be, but she is exactly wants us to be, and has wanted us to be from the beginning: discontent. Facebook started as a popularity contest web page on the Harvard campus. It fed off of discontent people who were comparing themselves to others. As it has grown, it has always promised to help us connect to our friends. But it''s true driving force has never been hidden too far beneath the surface: capitalizing on our feeling of disconnectedness.</p>\n\n<p>The irony is that Facebook is making us more disconnected. A quick <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=facebook+unhappy">Google search</a> reveals countless studies which have observed a correlation between the amount we use Facebook, and how discontent we are with our lives.</p>\n\n<p>I have a lot of reasons for quitting, which I explain below, but my desire to quit comes down to this;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Facebook lies. Facebook tells us that friendship should be easy and convenient, but friendship is not easy. Relationships take work, intentionality and sacrifice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I''m not saying that Facebook is evil, or that it isn''t useful for communicating with friends. For someone like me who lives internationally, Facebook is an easy and effortless way to stay in touch. I''ve just realized that, for me, Facebook isn''t the most conducive medium for building the genuine relationships that I want in my life.</p>\n\n<p>I no longer want my social life to be defined by passive scrolling through a "News Feed" and liking anything I find interesting while ignoring everything else. I want to connect with my friends via more intentional mediums; face to face, phone calls, email and blogs. It might be more inconvenient, more lonely or less popular, but it will be more real, and that''s what I want.</p>\n\n<p>If you''re reading this, I''d like to invite you to connect with me through one of those mediums;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>US Phone:  (330) 962-3620</li>\n<li>DR Phone: (829) 404-7535</li>\n<li>Email: josiah.sprague@gmail.com</li>\n<li>Subscribe to my blog.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>My List of Reasons To Quit Facebook</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Real friendships take real effort.\nNothing worth anything is cheap.The more we have to invest in a relationship, the more meaningful is becomes to us. The timeless truth is that "Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." I want my friendships to be treasured, and to require two-way investment.</li>\n<li>Facebook is compulsive.\nI don''t think I suffer from Facebook addiction, nor am I even sure that it''s possible to be addicted to Facebook. What I do know is that Facebook creates compulsive behavior. They have a financial interest in using social science to compel people to spend more time on Facebook. I don''t want to be compelled by the financial interests of a corporation.</li>\n<li>Facebook isn''t important.\nUsers are already leaving Facebook in droves, and it is becoming increasingly less relevant to a younger audience. Personally, I wouldn''t invest my money in Facebook stock, because I think it''s on it''s way out. But even if it does stick around for awhile, "those who use [Facebook], [should do so] as if not engrossed in [it]. For this world in its present form is passing away"(<a href="https://www.youversion.com/bible/111/1co.7.31.niv">Source</a>).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In addition to that list, I''ve been asking myself; What do you have to show for the time you''ve spent on Facebook? When was the last time you spent a meaningful hour on Facebook? How many hours have you wasted?</p>\n\n<p>My conclusion is that Facebook is not a meaningful addition to my life. But I still find it useful, and had a lot of objections to quitting. In order to overcome those objections and cut Facebook out of my life, I made a list and addressed each objection individually. I''m sharing the list here for anyone else who has wanted to cut the Facebook cord, but found too many things holding them back.</p>\n\n<h2>My Objections to Quitting Facebook</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I chat with a lot of people on Facebook\nI''ve been getting in touch with the people I''ve regularly chatted with to tell them I''m leaving Facebook. Other options that I have for chat are; Google, texting and Twitter.</li>\n<li>I get a lot of blog traffic through Facebook\nAsk people who read my blog to subscribe via email. Campaign about this for two weeks on Facebook, Blog and through email.</li>\n<li>I log into a lot of other websites with my Facebook account\nTurn of Facebook platform and use Twitter or create an account instead.</li>\n<li>I use Facebook for work\nCreate a Facebook account with a fake name and no friends.</li>\n<li>I can contact anyone through Facebook\nExport contacts and maintain an actual address book: Google Contacts</li>\n<li>Facebook is how other people share photos with me\nAsk them to share photos in person, or through?...</li>\n<li>You never know when you''ll need your Facebook network. Social support - Byker''s story</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Other Objections to Quitting Facebook</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I get my news from Facebook</li>\n<li>That is how person X communicates. Communicating on their level.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How Do I Quit Facebook?</h2>\n\n<p>You can permanently delete your Facebook account here. That requires you to wait for two whole weeks and be careful to to use any website that you signed up for with Facebook. That''s plenty of time to second guess your decision. I wanted to have a little bit more control over my Facebook use and my decision to quit, so this is how I quit Facebook.</p>\n', 'Facebook is too easy, I quit!', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '372-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-05-01 16:04:29', '2013-05-01 16:04:29', '', 372, 'http://josiahsprague.com/372-revision-25/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The headline grabbed my attention, which I''m sure was the intended effect. But my first impression was more along the lines of "Tired of Seeing the Homeless?" and it made me kind of mad- just because someone is homeless doesn''t make them any less valuable. I see people devalue the homeless all the time and that attitude really gets under my skin. But I read the article, and I found that this wasn''t the attitude at all. The key word of the headline is "streets". Are you tired of seeing that people are forced to live on the streets?

I love how both platforms make it easy for people to share ideas and communicate openly and freely. I love that both serve as a sort of "public square" of the web and support discourse, democracy and free society.\r\n\r\nI''ve been inspired lately by the ways that some websites have integrated Twitter, and I wanted to bring the same kind of integration to WordPress and take it a step further; helping WordPress bloggers to spark discussions and discourse on Twitter and other social media sites with the powerful statements they are already making.\r\n\r\nSo, I made a WordPress plugin that does exactly that. The plugin was mostly inspired by two sources. The first was the toolbar on Medium.com that enables people to tweet or comment on the text they select. The second was <a href="http://storylineblog.com">Donald Miller''s Storyline blog</a>, where he''s been adding "(tweet this)" links to the end of powerful quotes. The plugin is called <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/quotable/">Quotable</a>, and it brings both of those ideas to WordPress.\r\n\r\nQuotable helps readers share your inspiring content in two ways; first, by highlighting the text that they like and clicking one button to share it on Twitter. Second, by adding a link to the bottom of all the block quotes in a post, that will instantly share it.\r\n<blockquote>\r\nQuotable helps your readers share inspiring quotes from your site and spark engaging dialogue.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nThe plugin really serves two crowds. The readers of WordPress blogs that have the Quotable plugin installed will be able to quickly and easily share quotes that they like, and the authors of WordPress blogs benefit from the increased sharing of their content.\r\n\r\nThe plugin is written in a way that enhances existing features of <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/">Yoast''s WordPress SEO plugin</a>. If a site uses that plugin to define Twitter accounts for the site and it''s authors, those accounts will be mentioned in the tweets created by Quotable, which will encourage new followers and create new readers.\r\n\r\nIf you manage a WordPress site, I''d love it if you <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/quotable/">give Quotable a try</a>. It''s the first version, and I hope to improve it as time goes on, so I would greatly appreciate your feedback. If you try it and like it, please share it with others. I hope that this plugin not only enhances your site, but also benefits discourse, democracy and free society on the web.', 'I made a thing for WordPress', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'made-thing-wordpress', '', '', '2014-05-08 22:02:02', '2014-05-08 22:02:02', '', 0, 'http://josiahsprague.com/?p=786', 0, 'post', '', 0);

She does what has become an infamous habit in our world; she pulls out her phone for something more entertaining.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that she is more interested in her phone than in the people around her isn''t shocking.

It''s offensive.</p>\n\n<p>The girl in the video is the antithesis of who I want to be, but she is exactly wants us to be, and has wanted us to be from the beginning: discontent. Facebook started as a popularity contest web page on the Harvard campus. It fed off of discontent people who were comparing themselves to others. As it has grown, it has always promised to help us connect to our friends. But it''s true driving force has never been hidden too far beneath the surface: capitalizing on our feeling of disconnectedness.</p>\n\n<p>The irony is that Facebook is making us more disconnected.

This is one of the things I''m going to miss the most, but there are other options for chatting. After leaving Facebook, I plan to chat via Google Talk, texting and Twitter.</li>\n<li>I get a lot of blog traffic through Facebook\nI''ve been relying on Facebook to let friends and family know when I have a new blog post. Without Facebook people won''t know when I''ve posted something new to my blog, so I''ve set my blog up so that friends and family can <a href="http://eepurl.com/pWuUX">subscribe via email</a> or <a href="http://josiahsprague.com/feed/">RSS feed</a>. If you''re not subscribed already, please subscribe now.</li>\n<li>I log into a lot of other websites with my Facebook account\nThis is a dependency on Facebook that I developed without realizing it. I''ve signed up for so many websites using Facebook, and once I delete my Facebook, many of those accounts will be deleted as well. This was easy to solve. A few weeks ago I <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5993771/the-nuclear-option-for-total-facebook-app-privacy">turned off Facebook platform</a> which disabled all apps, games, and other websites connected to my Facebook account, and I''ve been using Twitter instead as my login for third party websites.</li>\n<li>I use Facebook for work\nEvery job I''ve had since college, including <a href="http://doulosdiscovery.org/about/our-staff/josiah-sprague/">my job at Doulos</a>, has required me to use Facebook to administrate company pages or develop Facebook apps. I can''t fulfill those responsibilities without a Facebook account, so I created a new account without my full name, and with no friend connections or personal information so that I can login to do my job. This has an added benefit of having a lot less social distractions at work.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>* I can contact anyone through Facebook\nThis is my fault, for being lazy and not bother to get people''s other contact information. Once I realized this, I spent some time getting other contact information from my Facebook friends and adding it to my address book. In the process I''ve realized that it''s never a good idea to trust one company with your contacts. Facebook has that stuff locked down, and it took a lot of work to get my information out. I used Google Contacts to export my address book to a open CSV file that I can store on my own computer.\n* Facebook is how other people share photos with me\nAsk them to share photos in person, or through?...\n* You never know when you''ll need your Facebook network.

Facebook is a really convenient place to share photos with friends and family, and for them to share photos with you. There are definitely other options for photo sharing, and though they may not be convenient, maybe sharing less photos online will mean more opportunities to sit down side by side with someone and share photos.

While stories like that are really moving examples of the power that a social network can have, the real human connections that made that happen exist apart from Facebook.

This is one of the things I''m going to miss the most, but there are other options for chatting. After leaving Facebook, I plan to chat via Google Talk, texting and Twitter.</li>\n	<li><strong>I get a lot of blog traffic through Facebook.</strong>\nI''ve been relying on Facebook to let friends and family know when I have a new blog post. Without Facebook people won''t know when I''ve posted something new to my blog, so I''ve set my blog up so that friends and family can <a href="http://eepurl.com/pWuUX">subscribe via email</a> or <a href="http://josiahsprague.com/feed/">RSS feed</a>. If you''re not subscribed already, please subscribe now.</li>\n	<li><strong>I log into a lot of other websites with my Facebook account.</strong>\nThis is a dependency on Facebook that I developed without realizing it. I''ve signed up for so many websites using Facebook, and once I delete my Facebook, many of those accounts will be deleted as well. This was easy to solve. A few weeks ago I <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5993771/the-nuclear-option-for-total-facebook-app-privacy">turned off Facebook platform</a> which disabled all apps, games, and other websites connected to my Facebook account, and I''ve been using Twitter instead as my login for third party websites.</li>\n	<li><strong>I use Facebook for work.</strong>\nEvery job I''ve had since college, including <a href="http://doulosdiscovery.org/about/our-staff/josiah-sprague/">my job at Doulos</a>, has required me to use Facebook to administrate company pages or develop Facebook apps. I can''t fulfill those responsibilities without a Facebook account, so I created a new account without my full name, and with no friend connections or personal information so that I can login to do my job. This has an added benefit of having a lot less social distractions at work.</li>\n	<li><strong>I can contact anyone through Facebook.</strong>\nThis is my fault, for being lazy and not bother to get people''s other contact information. Once I realized this, I spent some time getting other contact information from my Facebook friends and adding it to my address book. In the process I''ve realized that it''s never a good idea to trust one company with your contacts. Facebook has that stuff locked down, and it took a lot of work to get my information out. I used Google Contacts to export my address book to a open CSV file that I can store on my own computer.</li>\n	<li><strong>Facebook is how other people share photos with me.</strong>\nThis was my original excuse for not quitting Facebook years ago. Facebook is a really convenient place to share photos with friends and family, and for them to share photos with you. There are definitely other options for photo sharing, and though they may not be convenient, maybe sharing less photos online will mean more opportunities to sit down side by side with someone and share photos. I think I''ve also got a narcissistic desire to see the photos that others have taken of me. I''ll miss that, but it''s probably a healthy thing to lose.</li>\n	<li><strong>You never know when you''ll need your Facebook network.</strong>\nFacebook has allowed people to take advantage of their relational networks in amazing ways. A few months ago, <a href="http://caminandoporfe--jandcinthedr.blogspot.com/">a friend of mine</a> was able to raise tens of thousands of dollars overnight to save the life of his newborn daughter, and his Facebook connections played a large part in that effort. While stories like that are really moving examples of the power that a social network can have, the real human connections that made that happen exist apart from Facebook. If something happens that my network needs to know about, it will be shared by those people on whatever websites they spend their time on. It doesn''t necessarily have to be Facebook, and the number of human connections that I have with others will never be determined by a friend or follower count.</li>\n	<li><strong>Facebook is how person X communicates.</strong>\nMany of my Facebook friends are students that I''ve worked with as an RA, doing urban youth ministry, and working at a school in the Dominican Republic. Facebook is the primary way that many of them communicate online - they don''t use email, Twitter, etc. A friend of mine suggested that the reason he doesn''t quit Facebook is because we wants to be able to connect with those students "on their level". I think we need mentors who are willing to connect with people wherever they are. I deeply respect those that have made the decision to be on Facebook for that reason, and I wouldn''t argue with them to change.

In order to overcome those objections and cut Facebook out of my life, I made a list and addressed each objection individually. I''m sharing the list here for anyone else who has wanted to cut the Facebook cord, but found too many things holding them back.\r\n<h2>Objections to Quitting Facebook</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>I chat with a lot of people on Facebook.</strong>\r\nFacebook is a really convenient way to chat. This is one of the things I''m going to miss the most, but there are other options for chatting. After leaving Facebook, I plan to chat via Google Talk, texting and Twitter.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>I get a lot of blog traffic through Facebook.</strong>\r\nI''ve been relying on Facebook to let friends and family know when I have a new blog post. Without Facebook people won''t know when I''ve posted something new to my blog, so I''ve set my blog up so that friends and family can <a href="http://eepurl.com/pWuUX">subscribe via email</a> or <a href="http://josiahsprague.com/feed/">RSS feed</a>. If you''re not subscribed already, please subscribe now.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>I log into a lot of other websites with my Facebook account.</strong>\r\nThis is a dependency on Facebook that I developed without realizing it. I''ve signed up for so many websites using Facebook, and once I delete my Facebook, many of those accounts will be deleted as well. This was easy to solve. A few weeks ago I <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5993771/the-nuclear-option-for-total-facebook-app-privacy">turned off Facebook platform</a> which disabled all apps, games, and other websites connected to my Facebook account, and I''ve been using Twitter instead as my login for third party websites.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>I use Facebook for work.</strong>\r\nEvery job I''ve had since college, including <a href="http://doulosdiscovery.org/about/our-staff/josiah-sprague/">my job at Doulos</a>, has required me to use Facebook to administrate company pages or develop Facebook apps. I can''t fulfill those responsibilities without a Facebook account, so I created a new account without my full name, and with no friend connections or personal information so that I can login to do my job. This has an added benefit of having a lot less social distractions at work.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>I can contact anyone through Facebook.</strong>\r\nThis is my fault, for being lazy and not bother to get people''s other contact information. Once I realized this, I spent some time getting other contact information from my Facebook friends and adding it to my address book. In the process I''ve realized that it''s never a good idea to trust one company with your contacts. Facebook has that stuff locked down, and it took a lot of work to get my information out. I used Google Contacts to export my address book to a open CSV file that I can store on my own computer.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Facebook is how other people share photos with me.</strong>\r\nThis was my original excuse for not quitting Facebook years ago. Facebook is a really convenient place to share photos with friends and family, and for them to share photos with you. There are definitely other options for photo sharing, and though they may not be convenient, maybe sharing less photos online will mean more opportunities to sit down side by side with someone and share photos. I think I''ve also got a narcissistic desire to see the photos that others have taken of me. I''ll miss that, but it''s probably a healthy thing to lose.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>You never know when you''ll need your Facebook network.</strong>\r\nFacebook has allowed people to take advantage of their relational networks in amazing ways. A few months ago, <a href="http://caminandoporfe--jandcinthedr.blogspot.com/">a friend of mine</a> was able to raise tens of thousands of dollars overnight to save the life of his newborn daughter, and his Facebook connections played a large part in that effort. While stories like that are really moving examples of the power that a social network can have, the real human connections that made that happen exist apart from Facebook. If something happens that my network needs to know about, it will be shared by those people on whatever websites they spend their time on. It doesn''t necessarily have to be Facebook, and the number of human connections that I have with others will never be determined by a friend or follower count.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Facebook is how person X communicates.</strong>\r\nMany of my Facebook friends are students that I''ve worked with as an RA, doing urban youth ministry, and working at a school in the Dominican Republic. Facebook is the primary way that many of them communicate online - they don''t use email, Twitter, etc. A friend of mine suggested that the reason he doesn''t quit Facebook is because we wants to be able to connect with those students "on their level". I think we need mentors who are willing to connect with people wherever they are. I deeply respect those that have made the decision to be on Facebook for that reason, and I wouldn''t argue with them to change. But my perspective is that very few people connect with others on Facebook exclusively, and many students on Facebook are there to connect with their friends, not their mentors.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<blockquote>The real question is not whether to quit Facebook, but which medium will allow me to best connect and build relationships with the people I am trying to reach.</blockquote>\r\n<h2>How Do I Quit Facebook?</h2>\r\nIf this post has got you thinking about how you can quit Facebook, You can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account">permanently delete your Facebook account here</a>.

Without Facebook people won''t know when I''ve posted something new to my blog, so I''ve set my blog up so that friends and family can <a href="http://eepurl.com/pWuUX">subscribe via email</a> or <a href="http://josiahsprague.com/feed/">RSS feed</a>. If you''re not subscribed already, please subscribe now.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>I log into a lot of other websites with my Facebook account.</strong>\r\nThis is a dependency on Facebook that I developed without realizing it. I''ve signed up for so many websites using Facebook, and once I delete my Facebook, many of those accounts will be deleted as well. This was easy to solve. A few weeks ago I <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5993771/the-nuclear-option-for-total-facebook-app-privacy">turned off Facebook platform</a> which disabled all apps, games, and other websites connected to my Facebook account, and I''ve been using Twitter instead as my login for third party websites.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>I use Facebook for work.</strong>\r\nEvery job I''ve had since college, including <a href="http://doulosdiscovery.org/about/our-staff/josiah-sprague/">my job at Doulos</a>, has required me to use Facebook to administrate company pages or develop Facebook apps. I can''t fulfill those responsibilities without a Facebook account, so I created a new account without my full name, and with no friend connections or personal information so that I can login to do my job. This has an added benefit of having a lot less social distractions at work.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>I can contact anyone through Facebook.</strong>\r\nThis is my fault, for being lazy and not bother to get people''s other contact information. Once I realized this, I spent some time getting other contact information from my Facebook friends and adding it to my address book. In the process I''ve realized that it''s never a good idea to trust one company with your contacts. Facebook has that stuff locked down, and it took a lot of work to get my information out. I used Google Contacts to export my address book to a open CSV file that I can store on my own computer.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Facebook is how other people share photos with me.</strong>\r\nThis was my original excuse for not quitting Facebook years ago. Facebook is a really convenient place to share photos with friends and family, and for them to share photos with you. There are definitely other options for photo sharing, and though they may not be convenient, maybe sharing less photos online will mean more opportunities to sit down side by side with someone and share photos. I think I''ve also got a narcissistic desire to see the photos that others have taken of me. I''ll miss that, but it''s probably a healthy thing to lose.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>You never know when you''ll need your Facebook network.</strong>\r\nFacebook has allowed people to take advantage of their relational networks in amazing ways. A few months ago, <a href="http://caminandoporfe--jandcinthedr.blogspot.com/">a friend of mine</a> was able to raise tens of thousands of dollars overnight to save the life of his newborn daughter, and his Facebook connections played a large part in that effort. While stories like that are really moving examples of the power that a social network can have, the real human connections that made that happen exist apart from Facebook. If something happens that my network needs to know about, it will be shared by those people on whatever websites they spend their time on. It doesn''t necessarily have to be Facebook, and the number of human connections that I have with others will never be determined by a friend or follower count.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Facebook is how person X communicates.</strong>\r\nMany of my Facebook friends are students that I''ve worked with as an RA, doing urban youth ministry, and working at a school in the Dominican Republic. Facebook is the primary way that many of them communicate online - they don''t use email, Twitter, etc. A friend of mine suggested that the reason he doesn''t quit Facebook is because we wants to be able to connect with those students "on their level". I think we need mentors who are willing to connect with people wherever they are. I deeply respect those that have made the decision to be on Facebook for that reason, and I wouldn''t argue with them to change. But my perspective is that very few people connect with others on Facebook exclusively, and many students on Facebook are there to connect with their friends, not their mentors.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThe real question is not whether to quit Facebook, but which medium will allow me to best connect and build relationships with the people I am trying to reach?\r\n<h2>How Do I Quit Facebook?</h2>\r\nIf this post has got you thinking about how you can quit Facebook, You can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account">permanently delete your Facebook account here</a>. That requires you to wait for two whole weeks and be careful to to use any website that you signed up for with Facebook. That''s plenty of time to second guess your decision. I wanted to have a little bit more control over my Facebook use and my decision to quit, so <a href="http://www.suicidemachine.org/">this is how I plan to quit Facebook</a>.', 'I''m Quitting Facebook', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '372-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-05-01 17:23:58', '2013-05-01 17:23:58', '', 372, 'http://josiahsprague.com/372-revision-37/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

But for this post I''m just going to focus on Facebook and how when you give them an inch, they take a mile.\r\n\r\nFacebook has been slowly taking over communication with our friends for profit since 2004. Many of us think that Facebook''s purpose is to give us a better way to connect with our friends, but there''s a subtle but important difference; Facebook''s goal is to become<em> the primary way</em> we communicate with our friends. It''s in Facebook''s interest for us to depend on their service to reach our friends.\r\n\r\nWhen I first decided to quit, I was shocked by how many of my friends I didn''t know how to reach outside of Facebook. I didn''t have contact information for hundreds of friends, family, colleagues, co-workers, donors and other connections. It''s really hard to quit Facebook when you depend on it as the only way to reach others, so I set out to get other forms of contact information and what I discovered is that Facebook is <em>actively preventing</em> people from connecting in other ways.\r\n\r\nIn 2012 <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5921095/facebook-just-changed-your-email-without-permission-heres-how-to-get-it-back">Facebook changed your email address</a>.

Most of you probably didn''t even notice, but go look at your profile right now. Your default email address, the one that''s displayed publicly on your profile, is @facebook.com, and your real email address, if you had made it public before, is now hidden without your permission. That means, if you wanted people to be able to contact you by email, unless you caught Facebook''s sneaky change when it happened, those people have been directed to contact you through Facebook instead. Maybe it''s not a big deal to just change your email address back, but Facebook can sneak these subtle tricks in unnoticed at any time.\n\nAnother sneaky trick that I mentioned in <a title="I’m Quitting Facebook" href="http://josiahsprague.com/quitting-facebook/">my last post</a>, is the new Facebook Home feature for Android phones. By convincing people to install a Facebook app as the screensaver on their phones, Facebook is effectively <em>preventing people from connecting</em> via their phone numbers by putting software on our phones that intercepts us before we send a text or make a phone call. We are quickly becoming dependent on Facebook as our primary form of communication because it''s the most available and convenient, but that''s not a good thing.\n\nHow many times have you been annoyed because the latest Facebook update changed where or how you find the things that you''re looking for? Facebook doesn''t make those changes because they want the site to look prettier, or because they want to make it easier for us to communicate with our friends freely. They make those changes because they will generate more profit. The more time we spend doing the things that Facebook wants us to do, the more money they make. And that''s the bottom line; you''re not on Facebook because it helps you connect with your friends (were you unable to connect with your friends before?), you''re on Facebook because they''ve attracted you and they''re using you to make a profit.\n\nIt''s important to understand this; Facebook isn''t a product we use to keep in touch, we are the product that Facebook uses to make money. We''re selling, or rather giving, ourselves and our friendships to Facebook and that doesn''t come without a cost to the quality of our relationships.\n\nTake the news feed for example;  scrolling through and seeing our friends posts gives us the illusion that we''ve kept in touch with our friends, but we mostly post positive things, so if we''re not doing anything cool or interesting, we look at Facebook and see all the cool things our friends are doing and how interesting their life is and we feel left out and boring. Worse, if we''re down, or going through a hard time, and really need a friend, we usually don''t post it on Facebook for fear of seeming negative or desperate. In the end, it''s not very genuine. It turns friendship into a fair-weather affair; if it''s entertaining, we participate. If not, we ignore it.\n\nFacebook doesn''t own my relationships.

(423, 1, '2013-05-05 22:46:55', '2013-05-05 22:46:55', 'A lot of people talk about wanting to quit Facebook because its a time waster. That''s such a common sentiment, that a lot of people have misunderstood my reasons for quitting to be because I think I spend too much time there. They''ve said that the problem is really my time management and that it''s just as simple as turning off the computer and doing something else.\n\nThat has caused me to second guess whether my real reason for quitting is just because I''m terrible at managing my time. I really appreciate my friends who were willing to challenge me, because it got me thinking and refining my ideas about <a title="I’m Quitting Facebook" href="http://josiahsprague.com/quitting-facebook/">why I''m quitting</a>. Spending too much time on Facebook isn''t the problem. When we spend too much time on Facebook, it''s just a symptom of the real problem.\n\nThe real problem is who controls our relationships with other people. Do we control our relationships, or are they controlled by a third party? You''d probably argue that it''s your choice to control your own relationships, and that Facebook isn''t controlling them. But I argue that just by choosing to use it, we''re giving Facebook complete control over how we stay in contact with our friends.  By the way, the problem isn''t just Facebook, it can happen with any online service that we use (Google, Amazon, Apple, etc), and we should be aware of that. But for this post I''m just going to focus on Facebook and how when you give them an inch, they take a mile.\n\nFacebook has been slowly taking over communication with our friends for profit since 2004. Many of us think that Facebook''s purpose is to give us a better way to connect with our friends, but there''s a subtle but important difference; Facebook''s goal is to become<em> the primary way</em> we communicate with our friends. It''s in Facebook''s interest for us to depend on their service to reach our friends.\n\nWhen I first decided to quit, I was shocked by how many of my friends I didn''t know how to reach outside of Facebook. I didn''t have contact information for hundreds of friends, family, colleagues, co-workers, donors and other connections.

This is one of the things I''m going to miss the most, but there are other options for chatting. After leaving Facebook, I plan to chat via Google Talk, texting and Twitter.</li>\n	<li><strong>I get a lot of blog traffic through Facebook.</strong>\nI''ve been relying on Facebook to let friends and family know when I have a new blog post. Without Facebook people won''t know when I''ve posted something new to my blog, so I''ve set my blog up so that friends and family can <a href="http://eepurl.com/pWuUX">subscribe via email</a> or <a href="http://josiahsprague.com/feed/">RSS feed</a>. If you''re not subscribed already, please subscribe now.</li>\n	<li><strong>I log into a lot of other websites with my Facebook account.</strong>\nThis is a dependency on Facebook that I developed without realizing it. I''ve signed up for so many websites using Facebook, and once I delete my Facebook, many of those accounts will be deleted as well. This was easy to solve. A few weeks ago I <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5993771/the-nuclear-option-for-total-facebook-app-privacy">turned off Facebook platform</a> which disabled all apps, games, and other websites connected to my Facebook account, and I''ve been using Twitter instead as my login for third party websites.</li>\n	<li><strong>I use Facebook for work.</strong>\nEvery job I''ve had since college, including <a href="http://doulosdiscovery.org/about/our-staff/josiah-sprague/">my job at Doulos</a>, has required me to use Facebook to administrate company pages or develop Facebook apps. I can''t fulfill those responsibilities without a Facebook account, so I created a new account without my full name, and with no friend connections or personal information so that I can login to do my job. This has an added benefit of having a lot less social distractions at work.</li>\n	<li><strong>I can contact anyone through Facebook.</strong>\nThis is my fault, for being lazy and not bother to get people''s other contact information. Once I realized this, I spent some time getting other contact information from my Facebook friends and adding it to my address book. In the process I''ve realized that it''s never a good idea to trust one company with your contacts. Facebook has that stuff locked down, and it took a lot of work to get my information out. I used Google Contacts to export my address book to a open CSV file that I can store on my own computer.</li>\n	<li><strong>Facebook is how other people share photos with me.</strong>\nThis was my original excuse for not quitting Facebook years ago. Facebook is a really convenient place to share photos with friends and family, and for them to share photos with you. There are definitely other options for photo sharing, and though they may not be convenient, maybe sharing less photos online will mean more opportunities to sit down side by side with someone and share photos. I think I''ve also got a narcissistic desire to see the photos that others have taken of me. I''ll miss that, but it''s probably a healthy thing to lose.</li>\n	<li><strong>You never know when you''ll need your Facebook network.</strong>\nFacebook has allowed people to take advantage of their relational networks in amazing ways. A few months ago, <a href="http://caminandoporfe--jandcinthedr.blogspot.com/">a friend of mine</a> was able to raise tens of thousands of dollars overnight to save the life of his newborn daughter, and his Facebook connections played a large part in that effort. While stories like that are really moving examples of the power that a social network can have, the real human connections that made that happen exist apart from Facebook. If something happens that my network needs to know about, it will be shared by those people on whatever websites they spend their time on. It doesn''t necessarily have to be Facebook, and the number of human connections that I have with others will never be determined by a friend or follower count.</li>\n	<li><strong>Facebook is how person X communicates.</strong>\nMany of my Facebook friends are students that I''ve worked with as an RA, doing urban youth ministry, and working at a school in the Dominican Republic. Facebook is the primary way that many of them communicate online - they don''t use email, Twitter, etc. A friend of mine suggested that the reason he doesn''t quit Facebook is because we wants to be able to connect with those students "on their level". I think we need mentors who are willing to connect with people wherever they are. I deeply respect those that have made the decision to be on Facebook for that reason, and I wouldn''t argue with them to change. But my perspective is that very few people connect with others on Facebook exclusively, and many students on Facebook are there to connect with their friends, not their mentors.</li>\n</ol>\nThe real question is not whether to quit Facebook, but which medium will allow me to best connect and build relationships with the people I am trying to reach?\n<h2>How Do I Quit Facebook?</h2>\nIf this post has got you thinking about how you can quit Facebook, You can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account">permanently delete your Facebook account here</a>. That requires you to wait for two whole weeks and be careful to to use any website that you signed up for with Facebook. That''s plenty of time to second guess your decision. If you want a little bit more control over your information being deleted, <a href="http://www.suicidemachine.org/">you can try this tool</a>, but Facebook is trying to block it, so it might not work.

Facebook is the primary way that many of them communicate online - they don''t use email, Twitter, etc. A friend of mine suggested that the reason he doesn''t quit Facebook is because we wants to be able to connect with those students "on their level". I think we need mentors who are willing to connect with people wherever they are. I deeply respect those that have made the decision to be on Facebook for that reason, and I wouldn''t argue with them to change. But my perspective is that very few people connect with others on Facebook exclusively, and many students on Facebook are there to connect with their friends, not their mentors.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThe real question is not whether to quit Facebook, but which medium will allow me to best connect and build relationships with the people I am trying to reach?\r\n<h2>How Do I Quit Facebook?</h2>\r\nIf this post has got you thinking about how you can quit Facebook, You can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account">permanently delete your Facebook account here</a>. That requires you to wait for two whole weeks and be careful to to use any website that you signed up for with Facebook. That''s plenty of time to second guess your decision. I wanted to have a little bit more control over my Facebook use and my decision to quit, so <a href="http://www.suicidemachine.org/">this is how I plan to quit Facebook</a>.', 'I''m Quitting Facebook', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '372-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-05-01 17:24:27', '2013-05-01 17:24:27', '', 372, 'http://josiahsprague.com/372-revision-38/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

I had a great time in the Dominican; learned, accomplished and experienced a lot. Cultural adjustment was expected going in, and though I had difficult moments, overall, the adjustment of learning to engage with a new culture and language was pretty easy for me. But it changed me a lot, and the last few days of travel and reentering US culture have been an interesting view of they ways that I''ve changed.\r\n\r\nGoing through the airport in Santiago I realized how much Spanish I''ve learned in the last year. When I entered the country, everything sounded like a complete blur, and I could communicate more effectively using hand motions than anything else. On my way through the first security checkpoint, I understood enough to hear a pretty Dominican security guard tell me, "Hey redhead, you can''t take your beautiful blue eyes on the plane, we''re going to have to cut them out and leave them in this country." I still haven''t gotten very good at responding quickly in Spanish, so I just smiled-- she probably thought I didn''t understand.\r\n\r\nWatching the Dominican roads weaving through the mountains as we flew away, I felt that I had a much deeper understanding of how life looks along them than I did flying in-- it''s nothing like life along US roads. On our decent into Miami, I was impressed with how organized, planned, and orderly the city was. Cars flowing along large highways, all in their own lanes, driving with purpose from one large building to another.\r\n\r\nThe airports weren''t as shocking to me as I thought they would be, probably because I didn''t have much time to stop as I rushed through them from flight to flight, but was surprised that there was no free WiFi until Columbus. If you don''t have a cellular data plan in this country, you''re pretty much out of luck.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine picked me up at the airport and took me to a Five Iron Frenzy show. I can''t tell you how much I love ska, and how much I''ve missed being able to just dance with a crowd of people to music that I actually like. I''m not a big fan of Dominican merengue or bachata, and despite being in the Caribbean, ska isn''t very well known in the country. I wish I could share the experience with some of my more hippy friends from the DR, I know they would love it.\r\n\r\nAfter the Five Iron show, we went to IHOP. I forgot how hard it is to find an item on the menu that doesn''t have eggs here! In the Dominican, you can just ask for things without mayonnaise (which they put on everything!) and you''ll be fine. Allergies are way more convenient there.\r\n\r\nThe drive to Akron from Columbus was surreal. The highways were so huge, and empty and lonely. No businesses, people, or motorcycles along the side. It''s weird to feel like your home is a foreign country.\r\n\r\nI spent a lot of time on the highway the last three days. I drove with my family to Cincinnati for my cousin''s wedding. I hadn''t seen most of the people there since my other cousin''s wedding last year. It was shocking to see how much some people had changed; one cousin was way taller, another family member looked way older, a lot of people had gained a few pounds; or it might have just been my perception. Dominicans are really skinny.\r\n\r\nNow I''m headed to Kenmore, and I''m going to stop at the Chapel in Akron for church tonight. It will be interesting to worship in such a large place, with so many fancy lights, and to hear a sermon in English.\r\n\r\nI''m looking forward to seeing all of my friends and community.

(577, 1, '2014-01-13 14:21:16', '2014-01-13 14:21:16', 'When I first started working with Doulos, it reminded me a lot of my high school, Cuyahoga Valley Christian Academy. Both are private Christian schools where the staff care deeply about the spiritual development of the students, and there is a strong culture of academic excellence that stands out from other schools. I sometimes feel that there is more in common between the culture of Doulos and CVCA than there is between CVCA and public schools in Ohio. But after spending a couple of years here I’ve begun to realize that there are also many cultural differences, and I long for the students here to learn and expand their view of the world and to be able to understand the values of my home culture.\r\n\r\nThat’s why I am so excited about <a href="http://doulosdiscovery.org/launching-exciting-new-exchange-student-partnership/">a new exchange student partnership between Doulos and CVCA</a>. It began this past semester with two CVCA students who came to study for a semester here at Doulos. I was so proud to have students here representing my alma mater (and they represented it very well). This semester, I am thrilled that two Doulos students have the opportunity to represent their school as exchange students at CVCA.\r\n\r\nOne of those students happens to be one of the first students I met when I came to visit Doulos with a team in April 2012. We were visiting homes of Dominican Doulos staff and no one on our team knew Spanish, so Darina came with us to translate. It is very exciting for me that a student who played a key role in introducing me to Dominican culture now has the opportunity to experience my home culture at the same high school I attended.\r\n\r\nYou might assume that the connection between Doulos and CVCA came about because of an intentional effort on my part, or on the part of the Danae LeMoine (another Doulos staff member who attended high school at CVCA), but that isn’t the case. The exchange program, and Danae and myself being here, all came about completely separately. It was as if God was working all three together without awareness on our part.\r\n\r\nIt is exciting to see how God works in ways that we don’t expect or plan for, interweaving cultures and experiences within his diverse Church. My hope is that through this partnership between Doulos and CVCA that more and more people would see and celebrate that beautiful connection that we have in Christ regardless of our culture and background, and that it would enable us to value and love each other more deeply across those boundaries.', 'An Organic Connection Across Diverse Cultural Backgrounds', '', 'draft', 'open', 'open', '', 'an-organic-connection-across-diverse-cultural-backgrounds', '', '', '2014-03-03 00:34:17', '2014-03-03 00:34:17', '', 0, 'http://josiahsprague.com/?p=577', 0, 'post', '', 0),

(500, 1, '2013-11-22 13:45:49', '2013-11-22 13:45:49', 'I just got back to Ohio after a 10 month stay in the Dominican Republic. I had a great time in the Dominican; learned, accomplished and experienced a lot. Cultural adjustment was expected going in, and though I had difficult moments, overall, the adjustment of learning to engage with a new culture and language was pretty easy for me. But it changed me a lot, and the last few days of travel and reentering US culture have been an interesting view of they ways that I''ve changed.\r\n\r\nGoing through the airport in Santiago I realized how much Spanish I''ve learned in the last year. When I entered the country, everything sounded like a complete blur, and I could communicate more effectively using hand motions than anything else. On my way through the first security checkpoint, I understood enough to hear a pretty Dominican security guard tell me, "Hey redhead, you can''t take your beautiful blue eyes on the plane, we''re going to have to cut them out and leave them in this country." I still haven''t gotten very good at responding quickly in Spanish, so I just smiled-- she probably thought I didn''t understand.\r\n\r\nWatching the Dominican roads weaving through the mountains as we flew away, I felt that I had a much deeper understanding of how life looks along them than I did flying in-- it''s nothing like life along US roads. On our decent into Miami, I was impressed with how organized, planned, and orderly the city was. Cars flowing along large highways, all in their own lanes, driving with purpose from one large building to another.\r\n\r\nThe airports weren''t as shocking to me as I thought they would be, probably because I didn''t have much time to stop as I rushed through them from flight to flight, but was surprised that there was no free WiFi until Columbus. If you don''t have a cellular data plan in this country, you''re pretty much out of luck.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine picked me up at the airport and took me to a Five Iron Frenzy show. I can''t tell you how much I love ska, and how much I''ve missed being able to just dance with a crowd of people to music that I actually like. I''m not a big fan of Dominican merengue or bachata, and despite being in the Caribbean, ska isn''t very well known in the country. I wish I could share the experience with some of my more hippy friends from the DR, I know they would love it.\r\n\r\nAfter the Five Iron show, we went to IHOP. I forgot how hard it is to find an item on the menu that doesn''t have eggs here! In the Dominican, you can just ask for things without mayonnaise (which they put on everything!) and you''ll be fine. Allergies are way more convenient there.\r\n\r\nThe drive to Akron from Columbus was surreal. The highways were so huge, and empty and lonely. No businesses, people, or motorcycles along the side. It''s weird to feel like your home is a foreign country.\r\n\r\nI spent a lot of time on the highway the last three days. I drove with my family to Cincinnati for my cousin''s wedding. I hadn''t seen most of the people there since my other cousin''s wedding last year. It was shocking to see how much some people had changed; one cousin was way taller, another family member looked way older, a lot of people had gained a few pounds; or it might have just been my perception. Dominicans are really skinny.\r\n\r\nNow I''m headed to Kenmore, and I''m going to stop at the Chapel in Akron for church tonight. It will be interesting to worship in such a large place, with so many fancy lights, and to hear a sermon in English.\r\n\r\nI''m looking forward to seeing all of my friends and community. I''ve missed you all. I''m back for the summer.

(501, 1, '2013-11-22 13:45:52', '2013-11-22 13:45:52', 'My list of reasons to quit Facebook has been slowly growing, but Facebook''s useful features have kept me hanging on until now. A few weeks ago I watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voWvqBsyYbE">an advertisement for Facebook Home</a> that put the final nail in the coffin.\r\n\r\nThe video portrays a girl, about my age, apparently bored at a family gathering. She does what has become an infamous habit in our world; she pulls out her phone for something more entertaining.\r\n\r\nThe fact that she is more interested in her phone than in the people around her isn''t shocking. We see this happen every day. I even see it here in the Dominican Republic. The thing that is shocking is the extent to which Facebook is celebrating and encouraging the habit. It''s offensive.\r\n\r\nThe girl in the video is the antithesis of who I want to be, but she is exactly what Facebook wants us to be, and has wanted us to be from the beginning: <em>discontent</em>. Facebook started as a popularity contest web page on the Harvard campus. It fed off of discontent people who were comparing themselves to others. As it has grown, it has always promised to help us connect to our friends. But it''s true driving force has never been hidden too far beneath the surface: <em>capitalizing on our feeling of disconnectedness</em>.\r\n\r\nThe irony is that Facebook is making us more disconnected. A quick <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=facebook+unhappy">Google search</a> reveals countless studies which have observed a correlation between the amount we use Facebook, and how discontent we are with our lives.\r\n\r\nI have a lot of reasons for quitting, which I explain below, but my desire to quit comes down to this;\r\n<blockquote>Facebook lies. Facebook tells us that friendship should be easy and convenient, but friendship is not easy. Relationships take work, intentionality and sacrifice.</blockquote>\r\nI''m not saying that Facebook is evil, or that it isn''t useful for communicating with friends. For someone like me who lives internationally, Facebook is an easy and effortless way to stay in touch. I''ve just realized that, for me, Facebook isn''t the most conducive medium for building the genuine relationships that I want in my life.\r\n\r\nI no longer want my social life to be defined by passive scrolling through a "News Feed" and liking anything I find interesting while ignoring everything else. I want to connect with my friends via more intentional mediums; face to face, phone calls, email and blogs. It might be more inconvenient, more lonely or less popular, but it will be more real, and that''s what I want.\r\n\r\nIf you''re reading this, I''d like to invite you to connect with me through one of those mediums;\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>US Phone: (330<span style="display: none;">000</span>) 962<span style="display: none;">000</span>-3620<span style="display: none;">000</span></li>\r\n	<li>DR Phone: (829<span style="display: none;">000</span>) 404<span style="display: none;">000</span>-7535<span style="display: none;">000</span></li>\r\n	<li>Email: josiah<span style="display: none;">000</span>.sprague<span style="display: none;">000</span>@gmail<span style="display: none;">000</span>.<span style="display: none;">000</span>com</li>\r\n	<li>Subscribe to my blog: <a href="http://josiahsprague.com/feed/">RSS Feed</a>, <a href="http://eepurl.com/pWuUX">Via Email</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>List of Reasons To Quit Facebook</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Real friendships take real effort.</strong>\r\nNothing worth anything is cheap.The more we have to invest in a relationship, the more meaningful is becomes to us. The timeless truth is that "Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." I want my friendships to be treasured, and to be built on two-way investment.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Facebook is compulsive.</strong>\r\nI don''t think I suffer from Facebook addiction, nor am I even sure that it''s possible to be addicted to Facebook. What I do know is that Facebook creates compulsive behavior. They have a financial interest in using social science to compel people to spend more time on Facebook. I don''t want to be compelled by the financial interests of a corporation.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Facebook isn''t important.</strong>\r\n<a href="http://www.opposingviews.com/i/technology/internet/millions-users-leaving-facebook">Millions of people are already leaving Facebook</a>, and it is becoming increasingly less relevant to a younger audience. Personally, I wouldn''t invest my money in Facebook stock, because I think it''s on it''s way out. But even if it does stick around for awhile, "those who use [Facebook], [should do so] as if not engrossed in [it]. For this world in its present form is passing away" (<a href="https://www.youversion.com/bible/111/1co.7.31.niv">Source</a>). That has made me ask myself; What do you have to show for the time you''ve spent on Facebook? When was the last time you spent a meaningful hour on Facebook? How many hours have you wasted?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nMy conclusion is that Facebook is not a meaningful addition to my life. But I still find it useful, and had a lot of objections to quitting. In order to overcome those objections and cut Facebook out of my life, I made a list and addressed each objection individually. I''m sharing the list here for anyone else who has wanted to cut the Facebook cord, but found too many things holding them back.\r\n<h2>Objections to Quitting Facebook</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>I chat with a lot of people on Facebook.</strong>\r\nFacebook is a really convenient way to chat. This is one of the things I''m going to miss the most, but there are other options for chatting. After leaving Facebook, I plan to chat via Google Talk, texting and Twitter.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>I get a lot of blog traffic through Facebook.</strong>\r\nI''ve been relying on Facebook to let friends and family know when I have a new blog post. Without Facebook people won''t know when I''ve posted something new to my blog, so I''ve set my blog up so that friends and family can <a href="http://eepurl.com/pWuUX">subscribe via email</a> or <a href="http://josiahsprague.com/feed/">RSS feed</a>. If you''re not subscribed already, please subscribe now.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>I log into a lot of other websites with my Facebook account.</strong>\r\nThis is a dependency on Facebook that I developed without realizing it. I''ve signed up for so many websites using Facebook, and once I delete my Facebook, many of those accounts will be deleted as well. This was easy to solve. A few weeks ago I <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5993771/the-nuclear-option-for-total-facebook-app-privacy">turned off Facebook platform</a> which disabled all apps, games, and other websites connected to my Facebook account, and I''ve been using Twitter instead as my login for third party websites.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>I use Facebook for work.</strong>\r\nEvery job I''ve had since college, including <a href="http://doulosdiscovery.org/about/our-staff/josiah-sprague/">my job at Doulos</a>, has required me to use Facebook to administrate company pages or develop Facebook apps. I can''t fulfill those responsibilities without a Facebook account, so I created a new account without my full name, and with no friend connections or personal information so that I can login to do my job. This has an added benefit of having a lot less social distractions at work.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>I can contact anyone through Facebook.</strong>\r\nThis is my fault, for being lazy and not bother to get people''s other contact information. Once I realized this, I spent some time getting other contact information from my Facebook friends and adding it to my address book. In the process I''ve realized that it''s never a good idea to trust one company with your contacts. Facebook has that stuff locked down, and it took a lot of work to get my information out. I used Google Contacts to export my address book to a open CSV file that I can store on my own computer.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Facebook is how other people share photos with me.</strong>\r\nThis was my original excuse for not quitting Facebook years ago. Facebook is a really convenient place to share photos with friends and family, and for them to share photos with you. There are definitely other options for photo sharing, and though they may not be convenient, maybe sharing less photos online will mean more opportunities to sit down side by side with someone and share photos. I think I''ve also got a narcissistic desire to see the photos that others have taken of me. I''ll miss that, but it''s probably a healthy thing to lose.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>You never know when you''ll need your Facebook network.</strong>\r\nFacebook has allowed people to take advantage of their relational networks in amazing ways. A few months ago, <a href="http://caminandoporfe--jandcinthedr.blogspot.com/">a friend of mine</a> was able to raise tens of thousands of dollars overnight to save the life of his newborn daughter, and his Facebook connections played a large part in that effort. While stories like that are really moving examples of the power that a social network can have, the real human connections that made that happen exist apart from Facebook. If something happens that my network needs to know about, it will be shared by those people on whatever websites they spend their time on. It doesn''t necessarily have to be Facebook, and the number of human connections that I have with others will never be determined by a friend or follower count.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Facebook is how person X communicates.</strong>\r\nMany of my Facebook friends are students that I''ve worked with as an RA, doing urban youth ministry, and working at a school in the Dominican Republic. Facebook is the primary way that many of them communicate online - they don''t use email, Twitter, etc. A friend of mine suggested that the reason he doesn''t quit Facebook is because we wants to be able to connect with those students "on their level". I think we need mentors who are willing to connect with people wherever they are. I deeply respect those that have made the decision to be on Facebook for that reason, and I wouldn''t argue with them to change. But my perspective is that very few people connect with others on Facebook exclusively, and many students on Facebook are there to connect with their friends, not their mentors.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThe real question is not whether to quit Facebook, but which medium will allow me to best connect and build relationships with the people I am trying to reach?\r\n<h2>How Do I Quit Facebook?</h2>\r\nIf this post has got you thinking about how you can quit Facebook, You can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account">permanently delete your Facebook account here</a>. That requires you to wait for two whole weeks and be careful to to use any website that you signed up for with Facebook. That''s plenty of time to second guess your decision. If you want a little bit more control over your information being deleted, <a href="http://www.suicidemachine.org/">you can try this tool</a>, but Facebook is trying to block it, so it might not work. Personally, I used <a href="http://allfacebook.com/the-facebook-platform-kill-switch-what-it-means_b14673">the Facebook Platform kill switch</a>, spent a couple of weeks reaching out to people letting them know that I was planning to quit, used the official form to close down my account, and then blocked Facebook <a href="http://www.guidingtech.com/4868/edit-hosts-file-block-websites/">using my hosts file</a> for two weeks.', 'I''m Quitting Facebook', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '372-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-11-22 13:45:52', '2013-11-22 13:45:52', '', 372, 'http://josiahsprague.com/372-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

A major topic of conversation was an "identity crisis" of sorts that many of us our facing as new <a href="http://doulosdiscovery.org/about/our-staff/">Doulos staff</a>.\r\n\r\nAt one point, a friend visiting from out of town said, "It amazes me that you guys can pick up and move out of the country.

(507, 1, '2013-11-22 13:46:13', '2013-11-22 13:46:13', 'A few weeks ago, many of us experienced hurricane Sandy. Here in Jarabacoa, it was hardly more than a rainy day. Many of my friends in Ohio were out of power for a few days, and friends on the east coast witnessed some flooding first hand. I don''t personally know anyone who was hit very hard by the storm, but I know very few people who weren''t on alert about it. Storms bring a lot of chaos and danger, and it is only normal to be on alert when a storm is coming in.\r\n\r\nI was reading a story yesterday about a group of fishermen who were caught in a storm. They had been attending a public speaking event near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Galilee">Lake Tiberias</a>, and afterward they set sail in a small group of boats with the man who had been speaking. Soon after they set out, they found themselves caught in an intense storm and their tiny boat began filling with water. The fishermen were all on alert, but the speaker of the event was <em>asleep in the midst of the chaotic storm</em>.\r\n\r\nStorms have woken many of us while we''re safe and secure in our houses. It seems hard to believe that this man would have been able to sleep through an intense storm in a little boat that was filling with water. It kind of makes you wonder what this guy''s deal was. Was he crazy, or what? I bet the fishermen who were with him in the boat were wondering the same thing. They were probably even a bit annoyed that he was sleeping instead of grabbing a pail or a rope and helping them to keep the boat from sinking.\r\n\r\nWhat happened next in the story is even harder to believe, but it explains exactly why this guy was able to sleep through the storm. The fishermen yelled at him to wake him up, "Dude, wake up! Don''t you care that this boat is sinking?!". The speaker woke up, and without saying a word to the fishermen, looked up at the sky and said, "Enough! Be calm!" and<em> the waves instantly stopped tossing, and the skies cleared up</em>. Then, he turned to the fishermen and said, "Why are you afraid? Don''t you know who controls the storms?".\r\n\r\nI''d imagine if any of us had experienced that, we would have been pretty freaked out. The fishermen, who were used to handling a boat on a stormy sea, were probably more freaked out by this guy than they were by the storm. I mean, <em>who IS this guy</em>? All he has to do is say a word and he can make a raging storm stop instantly. The real thing to fear is not the storms, but the guy who can control them.\r\n\r\nIf you haven''t caught on by now, there are <a title="Mark 4:35-41" href="http://bible.us/111/mrk.4.35-41.niv">three</a> <a title="Matthew 8:23-27" href="http://bible.us/111/mat.8.23-27.niv">historical</a> <a title="Luke 8:22-25" href="http://bible.us/111/luk.8.22-25.niv">accounts</a> of this story, and the people in the boat were Jesus and his disciples. This experience taught the disciples a clear lesson about who God is, and we can learn from it as well. We often have our own storms. The chaos and struggles of life threaten to drown us if we don''t stay on alert and work hard to keep things from going under. Sometimes the last thing we are able to do is to rest in the midst of the chaos of life.\r\n\r\nMy own life has felt very vulnerable to being overwhelmed by the wind and waves of life in the last several months. I''ve experienced the chaos of wondering where my paycheck will come from, driving on some crazy roads with some crazy Dominican drivers, not understanding the language of my neighbors and not knowing who I can trust or who is out to take advantage of a naive gringo. It can be hard to rest when you''re constantly fighting to stay afloat.\r\n\r\nBut this story can teach us how to rest in the midst of a storm. Jesus'' question to his disciples was, "Why are you afraid? Do you still have no faith?" The key to having peace in a storm is to know the one who sets it''s boundaries and stills it''s fury, and to fear Him more than we fear the raging waters around us.\r\n\r\nI have been learning to trust God more than I fear the storms. I still have a lot to learn, but I know that I can rest knowing that God sets the limits and that all of the raging storms in my life are stilled at His command.

This is a very real heart-crisis for me, but I want to clarify to those of you who were concerned, I am not considering leaving Jarabacoa or Doulos. I am still convinced that this is where I am supposed to be right now.\r\n\r\nThe (mostly internal) trials that I am facing are painful, and I''d honestly like to avoid them, but they are <a title="Consider it pure joy whenever you encounter trials..." href="http://bible.us/100/jas.1.2-4.nasb">shaping me in a good way</a>, and in a way that I wouldn''t otherwise be shaped without them.\r\n\r\nWhen I read the Bible, I often notice that Jesus'' disciples, who had the privilege of being with Him in person, just didn''t get it. They didn''t understand who Jesus was, or what He was up to. I can relate to that. I''ve spent my entire life in close proximity to churches and religious institutions that are all centered around Jesus, and I can explain the simple truth of the Gospel in 50 different ways. But when it comes to my own salvation, it is still very much <a href="http://bible.us/100/php.2.12-13.nasb">a messy issue that I am working out daily</a>.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_181" align="alignleft" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-181" alt="A Kitten at Doulos" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ac3fec1221d311e2b3af22000a1fb856_7-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /> At times I feel as helpless as this Kitten that we found in the workshop at Doulos.[/caption]\r\n\r\nJust as the disciples, who were daily with Jesus in the flesh, I have no clue what Jesus is about.\r\n\r\n<strong>Sometimes I think Jesus is about living a well-rounded life.</strong>\r\n\r\nSo often in Christian communities we hold up people who have their life together; who are healthy, happy, wealthy and wise. At times, I feel envious when I am not exalted by others as being noble or strong or wise.\r\n\r\n<em>But Jesus is not about me having my life together. <a href="http://bible.us/100/1co.1.26-31.nasb">He is about using my weak, foolish, and sometimes despised self for His glory</a>.</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Sometimes I think Jesus is about having rewarding friendships.</strong>\r\n\r\nThe second greatest commandment, Jesus said, was to love your neighbor as yourself. I can''t envision a way to live out that truth without being a friend to my neighbor.  As an extrovert, I am very comfortable with the idea of being friends with everyone. I will almost never pass up an opportunity to be with friends.\r\n\r\n<em>But Jesus is not about me having an entertaining social life. <a href="http://bible.us/100/mat.5.46.nasb">He is about loving others even when they don''t love back</a>, and <a href="http://bible.us/100/mrk.1.35.nasb">He frequently separated Himself from His closest friends to spend time alone with God</a>.</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Sometimes I think Jesus is about being materially successful.</strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_182" align="alignleft" width="300"]<img class="size-medium wp-image-182" alt="Wildflower in Jarabacoa" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/0cede6c2205311e29f3f22000a1f978e_7-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /> Even when we are helpless, God takes care of us. (Luke 12:27-28)[/caption]\r\n\r\nCertainly working hard is a good thing, and a hard worker is worthy of his wages. I feel that if I work hard, I am entitled to a reward. I look forward to having a car (that works), and a house (with a big yard), and a lot of money to spend.\r\n\r\n<em> But Jesus isn''t about making bank. <a href="http://bible.us/100/mat.6.19-21.nasb">He said that where our money goes has a lot to do with where our heart is, and that we shouldn''t place too much value in physical stuff that won''t last</a>.</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Sometimes I think Jesus is about communicating well.</strong>\r\n\r\nA lot of the role models that I have are good communicators. C.S. Lewis was an amazing writer. Brian Kunkler is a great speaker. Jesus himself was pretty good at communication. I studied Communication in college and I often take pride in my ability to communicate well.\r\n\r\n<em>But Jesus isn''t about choosing people based on their ability to communicate cleverly. <a href="http://bible.us/100/exo.4.10.nasb">Moses could barely handle public speaking</a>, and <a href="http://bible.us/100/1co.2.1-4.nasb">Paul said that persuasive words don''t matter</a>.</em>\r\n\r\nLife in Jarabacoa is wrecking my ideas about what Jesus is about. My life is not as well rounded as I think it should be. But I am learning that God can use me anyway. My social life is not as strong as it was in the States, but I am learning that my relationship with God matters more than being accepted by others. I am not earning as much money as I want to be earning, but I am learning that the things I often value are an illusion. Sometimes I feel that the only things that are going smoothly are my work on the Doulos website, and my efforts to learn Spanish, but I am learning that those don''t earn me any more credit with God.\r\n\r\nI am learning that, just like His disciples, I have no clue what Jesus is about. But He is teaching me and changing me on a daily basis. I am joyful in the struggles I am facing, knowing that they are drawing my closer to Jesus and turning me into <a href="http://bible.us/100/jas.1.4.nasb">a person who has everything</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'I Have No Clue What Jesus Is About', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '180-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-11-22 13:46:17', '2013-11-22 13:46:17', '', 180, 'http://josiahsprague.com/180-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

I''ve learned how to cook yuca frita, salami, queso frito and tostones (all Dominican favorites) and I''ve discovered, surprisingly, that though they live in a country full of cheap avocados, most Dominicans have never heard of guacamole.

I had been spending the past several years settling into normal, post-college adult life, and I was beginning to get comfortable. I had an enjoyable job developing websites for a laid back eCommerce web development agency, and I envisioned myself living and working in northeast Ohio for the next several years.But alas, I didn''t know everything that was in store for me. In April, a coworker mentioned to me that he was taking a team of people to <a title="Expeditionary Learning Education in the Dominican Republic" href="http://doulosdiscovery.org/">Doulos Discovery School</a> in Jarabacoa for a week-long <a title="Missions Trip in the Dominican Republic" href="http://doulosdiscovery.org/opportunities/service-learning-trips/">Service Learning Trip</a>. The idea didn''t appeal to me, since I have had bad experiences with short term service trips in the past. But he continued to invite me and I decided, at the last minute, that the trip was a better way to spend my vacation time than any of the other ideas I had in mind.\r\n\r\nLittle did I know the huge impact that such a small decision would have on my life. (Take note; little decisions do matter.) Less than three full months later, I found myself leaving my comfortable, normal life in northeast Ohio to work full time at Doulos as their Media Coordinator. It feels a little bit crazy. There are a lot of challenges, and a lot of unknowns. But when I was presented with the opportunity, I couldn''t be content with the idea of turning it down.\r\n\r\nIt is as if I had been anticipating this opportunity my whole life, not knowing what it was until it was presented to me. The opportunity to communicate a story that I believe in, using tools with which I am trained and experienced, resonates with my soul. It is a story that I want to tell and a story in which I want to play a part.\r\n\r\nMy role at Doulos is to tell <a title="Founding Story of Doulos Discovery School" href="http://doulosdiscovery.org/about/founding-story/">the story of the school</a>—ultimately the story of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_news_(Christianity)">the Gospel</a>—using web and video media. I will be working to help Doulos create a bilingual, responsive website, which will help Doulos communicate with students, parents, community members and supporters. I will be creating videos to promote Doulos on the web and on local cable television, and I will help students and teachers communicate their stories to their sponsors.\r\n\r\nI also hope to immerse myself in Dominican culture, explore the country along with students on their <a title="Official Website of Expeditionary Learning Schools" href="http://elschools.org/">Expeditionary Learning</a> adventures and stay open to the unknown and unexpected. I expect life here to be full of ups and downs and adventures. I am all in and eager to see what God does with my life here.\r\n\r\nI welcome you to join me on this journey, please take a minute to <a href="http://eepurl.com/pbwzz">subscribe to my newsletter</a> and please email me at <a href="mailto:josiah.sprague@gmail.com">josiah.sprague@gmail.com</a> if you have any questions about how you can be a part.

I told him I didn''t have a cigarette, and that all I had was a ZipCard with a meal plan. He asked if I could get him a sandwich, so I did.\n\nAs I was waiting in line for the sandwich, I was thinking that I''m really not giving this guy much. I was thinking about what he really needs (probably); support, a job, friends, family... none of which I have the resources to give him. But as an adopted child of God through Jesus, I have access to God as a father and can ask Him for anything I need and He will provide. So I decided that I could give this man the blessing of prayer; coming before God with Him to ask God to provide for his real needs.\n\nAs I gave him his sandwich, he asked me again if I could give him a cigarette. I told him that I didn''t have one, but asked if I could give him what I do have; prayer. I had expected that he would say yes, sort of as an obligation for me buying him food, but instead his face lit up and he said, "I need that!", another man sitting on the bench said, "Hey! Can I get some of that too?" So I prayed for both of them, for all three of us- because I believe that God is faithful as a father to provide for the needs of His children.\n\nAs I left, both men were encouraged and saying, "Man, I need more of that in my life!" Isn''t that a need that we all have in common; the provision of our heavenly father who provides for all of our needs?

Implying that it was wrong for guys to work for bigger biceps.

He sees a grid of three things that Christians should run their activities through;\n<ol>\n	<li><strong>"Put to death" things that go against the revealed moral will of God.</strong> The things listed in Colossians 3.5-8 that go against the moral will of God include; sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, greed (which is idolatry), anger, rage, malice, slander and filthy language.</li>\n	<li><strong>Whose glory are we seeking?</strong> God has given us value as human beings and it is not anything we have to work for or earn. Colossians 3.11 says that Christ takes away any human measures of value- everyone is equally valuable (student, non-student, homeless, healthy, black, white, gay, straight...). Whatever Christians do should not be to earn respect from people, but to give glory to God.</li>\n	<li><strong>"Clothe yourselves with" virtues of God''s character.</strong> The virtues listed in Colossians 3.12 include; compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, patience, forgiveness (as Christ forgave you), and love, which binds all of these virtues together in unity.</li>\n</ol>\nTo sum up these three parts of the grid, Brian points to Colossians 3.17; "Whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God the Father."\n\nThe second part of the grid hit me really hard. Everything that I have been doing this semester has been motivated by a desire to earn people''s respect (my professors, my residents, my boss, my girlfriend, my small group, my roommates, etc). Something that Brian noticed, that I completely agree with, is that doing something to try to earn someone''s respect has a tendency to destroy the pleasure of that activity.\n\nI''ve come to the realization that there are some things that God hasn''t blessed me with (such as big biceps). If I am seeking to bless myself with these things I am probably not seeking God''s glory (so that people will worship God when they see how wonderfully He has made me) but I am seeking my own glory (so that people will respect me when they see the man that I have made myself to be).\n\n(Check out <a title="Campus Focus Podcast" href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=326679776" target="_blank">the weekly podcast of Campus Focus </a>to hear Brian''s message from this week as well as previous weeks.)', 'Mulligan', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '104-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-11-22 13:47:12', '2013-11-22 13:47:12', '', 104, 'http://josiahsprague.com/104-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Even if he is homeless, he still lives in the community- we ought to be ashamed if we are <a title="Isaiah 58:7 on BlueLetterBible.com" href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Isa&amp;c=58&amp;t=NIV#7" target="_blank">turning away our own flesh and blood</a>.\n\nI turned to someone and asked, "If someone is a member of the community, should they not be invited to the picnic?"\n\n"No, we didn''t invite sex offenders and criminals. We skipped the houses of sex offenders and criminals when we passed out fliers."\n\nI was frustrated that we were having this picnic to build a sense of community in the neighborhood so that future crime would be reduced and that everyone in the community was invited, except anyone with a criminal record. Oh, and anyone who looked dirty or unshaven, was being turned away too.\n\nI was wondering how many people at the picnic actually live in the neighborhood compared to people who were students just staying in the neigborhood temporarily. Associated Student Government kept track of who attended, so I got in touch with their office to get some statistics.\n\nThe statistics from the first Zipnic, which I attended weren''t very detailed- 281 people signed in. I didn''t attend the second picnic, but according to the statistics,  only 26% of the 351 people at the picnic were non-students. I can''t help but wonder if that percentage would have been higher if we hadn''t excluded those who don''t fit into our college student social class.\n\nAre these statistics a big deal? Not really... but are they indicative of a bigger problem? I think they may be... more thoughts later.', 'Community Zipnic Stats', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '87-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-11-22 13:47:18', '2013-11-22 13:47:18', '', 87, 'http://josiahsprague.com/87-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

I left it locked up by itself outside of Grant Residence Hall a week before classes started. I left it for a week, and when I came back for it, it was gone. In retrospect, I should have known better.\n\nPreventing theft is common sense, but sometimes we all need a little reminder. Hopefully it doesn''t take your bike getting stolen to remind you. I got an email from the University of Akron this weekend with a few useful tips for preventing theft. Some reminders based on their email;\n<ul type="disc">\n	<li>Don''t leave valuables where they are going to catch attention, like your car seat or the front window of your house. If potential thieves never see your valuables, they won''t be tempted.</li>\n	<li>Don''t leave valuables unsecured. Most thefts are crimes of opportunity. Thieves keep their eyes open for opportunities, but most thieves aren''t willing to do the work to make opportunities- don''t make the opportunities for them.</li>\n	<li>If you have valuables you are worried about losing, consider getting insurance coverage and/or an alarm system.</li>\n	<li>If you notice anything suspicious, let UA’s police department know. Call the department at 330-972-2911 at any hour.</li>\n</ul>\nThese are some good tips to remember. I''d like to add one more of my own that most people probably won''t like, but that I believe is the most important and timeless piece of advice;\n<ul>\n	<li>Don''t have a lot of stuff. There are better ways to invest your wealth than in material things.

It is a daily ritual on the edges of Akron''s campus; that awkward moment as a busy student passes a panhandler at a street corner or bus stop.\n\nSome hold signs, others tell stories. Some are visibly drunk or high, others are dirty. But the request is predictable; "My car ran out of gas around the corner. Can you help me out? I need a couple of bucks for a gas can...", "I haven''t eaten in two days and I''m hungry, do you have a ten so I can go get a pizza?", "My girl just left me with two kids and I''m just trying to get forty bucks to pay my electric bill."\n\nIt''s sad to see men and women in such distress. It evokes feelings of sympathy and a desire to help someone out. Yet helping these people often ends with the nagging thought that maybe giving money away to a stranger isn''t helping all that much. What if your sympathy is being taken advantage of? What if you''re actually feeding a person''s addiction and not the person? It''s hard not to wonder about the stranger''s motives.\n\nAccording to a <a title="Panhandling Brochurch [PDF]" href="http://www.downtownakron.com/_files/docs/panhandling-brochure.pdf">brochure</a> available from <a title="The Downtown Akron Partnership" href="http://downtownakron.com/" target="_blank">The Downtown Akron Partnership</a> most panhandlers are not homeless. In many cases, giving money to panhandlers  supports drug and alcohol addiction. Sometimes the best response is to just politely say no. Duane Crabbs, a street pastor of <a title="South Street Ministries Blog" href="http://southstreetministries.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">South Street Ministries</a> in Akron, says that when a person is struggling with addiction, almost anything you try to do for them is enabling their addiction.\n\nSympathy towards those in need is an appropriate response, but students should be wise about their giving. A number of organizations exist in and around Akron to help those in need. Students interested in giving can give to a local organization and when encountering a person in need, students can help by directing them to the appropriate organization. Students can refer to the <a title="Akron Street Card [PDF]" href="http://www.cvmsummit.net/Street%20Card%202009.pdf" target="_blank">Akron Street Card</a> for  a list of resources for those on the streets in Akron. The street card includes information about hundreds of organizations that can help with things from emergencies, to paying utilities, to getting fed and finding work.\n\nBut according to the <a title="The Haven of Rest" href="http://www.havenofrest.org" target="_blank">Haven of Rest</a>, sometimes what panhandlers truly lack is not money but bonds with others;  what many people are suffering from is a "profound disconnection from other people and institutions". Ryan Wells, a nursing student at the University of Akron, decided to face this need head on and get to know one of the panhandlers on campus;\n<blockquote>I’ve had the opportunity to get to know a gentleman who has been out of work for almost a year now. He’s got a place to crash, but no steady income, no stability. And after getting to know him, a lot of my hesitations proved true. Drugs were involved, alcohol too. But I’ve gotten to know and appreciate this man’s struggle. I can’t stress the importance of simply learning their story. Where are they at physically? Emotionally? Mentally? Spiritually? How are you really going to effectively help anyone without learning why they are the way they are? And I’ve found companionship and communication have served this man so much better than a 10-spot and a Tornado Burrito from Speedway ever could.</blockquote>\nPanhandlers are people with the same basic needs as anyone else. Don''t be afraid to get to know a panhandler. Ask them about their story. You may be surprised at what you gain from getting to know them, and they gain a friend in return. A good place to start is lunch in a public place. Not to feed them, but to sit down with them and get to know them.\n\nDISCLOSURE: This was written for a class I am enrolled in at <a title="The University of Akron" href="http://www.uakron.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Akron</a>.

Yes, I do know “right is wrong” and no, I am not coming out. Getting my right ear pierced is something that I’ve been thinking about doing for awhile. I finally did it. This is my explanation.\n\nOriginally, the only men who wore earrings were bond servants. In the Bible, in the Old Testament, when a person owned a slave, the slave was to serve him for six years and in the seventh year go free. But, when the seventh year came around it was not uncommon for a freed slave to voluntarily re-enter service to the master he loved. The master would take him to the doorpost and pierce his <a href="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=850&amp;letter=S">right ear</a> with an awl and the slave would become his bond servant for life. Only a freed slave could become a bond servant and once he had entered that service, he could never be freed again, nor could he be sold into slavery to another master. (Exodus 21:2-7)\n\nIn the New Testament, early Christians called themselves bond servants of Christ. Bond service is a two way commitment. The freed slave chooses to commit his life to the service of his master and his master commits himself to the bond servant, never to release or sell him. (Galatians 1:10, Philippians 2:7, Colossians 1:7, 2 Timothy 2:24)\n\nJesus has committed Himself to us. With His own blood, He paid our debt and freed us from the slavery of sin. We are free to serve whomever we choose. I choose Jesus, the one who loves me and gave Himself for me. He has made a commitment to love me. I have made a commitment to serve only Him. So, I got my ear pierced as symbol to all that I am a servant by choice and can neither be bought or sold.', 'Left is Right and Right is Wrong', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '40-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-11-22 13:47:34', '2013-11-22 13:47:34', '', 40, 'http://josiahsprague.com/40-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The book is full of challenges. While reflecting on my reading of the book, I wrote the following journal entry;\n<blockquote>Christ is not easy to follow. He promises life to the full, but it is not an extension of more of the things I want and admire. Full life is not in any way for my glory. but just the opposite. In order for the life and glory of God to increase in my life, I must become less. I must be willing to abandon myself, my glory and my lusts and ego, and follow Christ in death. This is difficult. Without faith in Christ, the son of God, it is impossible.</blockquote>\nI have been challenged lately to realized that following Jesus is not glamorous or sucessful. That thought doesn’t sit comfortably for me. My humanity has a natural aversion to suffering. I want as much success as possible. A quick quote from the book that caught my attention;\n<blockquote>The life of Jesus is not a happy story, not a success story. What it is… is a salvation story.</blockquote>\nI am learning more and more that following God means denying self. No matter how moral or compassionate or virtuous self may be at times, we must lose our lives to find them. Another quote that caught my attention is;\n<blockquote>The glory with which Jesus was glorified and the glory for which Jesus prayed for us is quite different from the kinds of glory that we are conditioned to want and admire. This glory is not conspicuous. It is not glamorous. It is not the glory that gets featured in glossy magazines or travel posters. It is not a glory noticed by fashion editors. It is not a glory that flatters our lusts and egos.</blockquote>\nIt is our natural tendency to use God for our own glory. But God’s glory is entirely other than our own.

I heard it justified as "safety", but I''m calling it how I see it. This was a picnic in the middle of the day, with plenty of watchful eyes and UAPD around, this was a safe place to interact with anyone save a militant terrorist. Excluding people from the picnic wasn''t a matter of safety, it was class discrimination. If someone didn''t appear to meet the standard of being a middle class college student with a clean record, they were discriminated against.\n\nStudents at <a href="http://www.uakron.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Akron</a> don''t hear a lot about class discrimination in <a title="The City of Akron on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akron,_Ohio" target="_blank">Akron</a>.

The truth is that our community is made up of two distinct social classes. The edge of a college campus in an urban setting is a place where poverty and affluence meet. It is a place where class discrimination can very easily sneak in if we are not intentional about avoiding it.\n\nI''d like to see the University of Akron have a picnic for the community that doesn''t discriminate based on class. <a title="Article 27 of the UDHR" href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a27" target="_blank">Article 27</a> of the <a title="UDHR" href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/" target="_blank">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> states that, "Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community." We should invite everyone who lives in the community, student or not, clean or dirty, rich or poor, criminal record or innocent, handicapped or healthy to be a part of our community picnics.

I''m not against drinking or having fun while doing it, but since when is alcohol a prerequisite to having fun? I think as college students we''ve forgotten how to have fun.\n\nMy idea of having fun growing up was to have people over for a campfire in my backyard. When I came to college I jumped on the drinking bandwagon for awhile, but then I realized that I could have just as much fun at a campfire and I had made a lot more valuable memories at campfires than my fragmented memories from a night out drinking.\n\nThere''s plenty of places to drink on campus, and legal or not, students find a way to do it. But one of the drawbacks of living on campus is that there aren''t quite as many places to have a campfire.\n\nThis year at the Townhouses we''re changing that by hosting cookouts in our "Townhouse backyard" where "We grill out to chill out." Instead of asking people to B.Y.O.B.,  we started by asking people to B.Y.O.G. (the g is for grill). Our first cookout we had 75 people show up, prompting us to create the B.Y.O._ series. Our third B.Y.O._ event is coming up on October 14 at 6:06pm, and is going to be a fall-themed cookout with corn stalks, scarecrows, pumpkin pie, cider and pumpkin carving.\n\nEveryone on campus is invited. B.Y.O.P. (pumpkin),  and B.Y.O.F (food, friends, fall spirit),  and come join us for a good time!\n\nUpdate: You can find <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=153581136906" target="_blank">the Facebook event </a>by searching for "B.Y.O._ Round Three" on Facebook.', 'B.Y.O._ Round Three', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '85-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-11-22 14:04:52', '2013-11-22 14:04:52', '', 85, 'http://josiahsprague.com/85-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Campus Focus is the second largest student organization at the University of Akron and growing in size. While many churches are losing attendance from the college age crowd, Campus Focus is growing.\n\nMany college students imagine church is about old people wearing their Sunday best and singing hymns, but students at Campus Focus are interested in something different. Brian Kunkler, the pastor at Campus Focus, explains what Campus Focus is about to a group of students,\n<blockquote>The God that we follow around here has a bigger vision for your life than you have for your life. The God who lingers around here, whom we’re going to sing songs to in just a minute, has a bigger dream for your life than you have for your own life and He’s desperate to lead you in it. This is a high change environment.</blockquote>\nCampus Focus is a collection of college students, from many different backgrounds who have come together in the name of Jesus Christ. All are welcome, regardless of their current beliefs, gender, race, social status or lifestyle. But Brian concludes his speech to students with a warning;\n<blockquote>Look at what happened to people when they lingered around Jesus. Here’s a sampling from the four gospels. The blind see. The lame walk.  The oppressed set free. The outcasts are welcomed as family. The prostitutes become women of honor. The tax collectors become servants of the true king. Common fishermen become world changers. Swindlers and cheats pay back what they stole, and even get generous. The guilty get forgiven. The sin stain get cleansed. The proud get humbled and the self-righteous bow the knee. Wherever Jesus is, change is soon to follow.</blockquote>\nThe Campus Focus website, <a title="campusfocus.org" href="http://www.campusfocus.org" target="_blank">campusfocus.org </a>welcomes students to come to a weekly meeting at <a title="The Chapel in Akron" href="http://www.the-chapel.org" target="_blank">The Chapel in Akron</a> every Thursday night at 7:30 to see what they are all about. You can also find a weekly podcast from Campus Focus on the website.\n\nDISCLOSURE: Campus Focus is a student organization at <a title="The University of Akron" href="http://www.uakron.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Akron</a> of which I am an active participant.

(537, 1, '2013-11-22 14:06:26', '2013-11-22 14:06:26', 'Looking around on the internet, I''m finding some trends as far as what makes a website successful. This is my no means a definitive list, but rather a quick summary of some things that I am drawn to on the web and why I think these things are essential for a successful website. While many of my observations apply to websites in general, my specific focus will be on portfolio websites.\r\n<h2>Some Rules of Successful Design</h2>\r\nWhat makes a website successful is, first and foremost, it''s purpose. The purpose of a website is to communicate a message. The message needs to be clearly defined, and every aspect of the website should do it''s part to communicate that message. All of the aspects of a website are secondary to the message of the site.\r\n\r\nThe message of a portfolio website is, most likely, "Hire me!". This message should be made clear, and supported by the content of the site. A successful portfolio site will include examples of work to communicate the author''s skill, as well as a call to action encouraging visitors to consider hiring.\r\n\r\nSome supporting factors that make any website effective in communicating a message include; consistent navigation, usable search, standards compliance, up to date information and effective monetization.\r\n<h2>Some Things to Avoid</h2>\r\nIn light of a website''s message, anything that does not contribute to or enhance the message should be avoided. A feature may be a powerful communication tool on one website and completely out of place on another. For example, a discussion board may be a very useful tool on a social media website, but on a professional portfolio it may be out of place.\r\n\r\nOther things to avoid are unnecessary Flash animations, sounds that play automatically, and features that use large amounts of resources. These things can be used occasionally in the right places but to use them all the time is sort of like putting salt on everything you eat. Not everything needs it, and sometimes it''s better without.\r\n<h2>Good Examples</h2>\r\nThere is no shortage of good examples of portfolio websites.  DesignM.ag has a list of <a title="101 Awesome Portfolio Sites" href="http://designm.ag/inspiration/101-awesome-portfolio-sites/" target="_blank">101 Awesome Portfolio Sites.</a> The number one thing that I like about most of these portfolio sites is that they are standards compliant. It might not seem like a big deal, but standards compliance is the backbone of a successful site. Everything is built out of code, so if the code is healthy, it lends itself to a healthy site.\r\n\r\nThe first site on DesignM.ag''s list is <a title="Spoon Graphics" href="http://www.spoongraphics.co.uk/" target="_blank">Spoon Graphics</a>. Not only does the site look great, but it achieves its purpose effectively. The first thing a visitor to the site sees is the banner across the middle of the page explaining what the site is and offering links to find out more, view the portfolio or hire Chris, the owner of the site.\r\n\r\nAnother portfolio that stands out to me from the list is <a title="Design Disease" href="http://designdisease.com/" target="_blank">Design Disease</a>. The thing that draws me to this site is the creative design. The site incorporates an ocean theme while still maintaining a site that is easy to navigate. Design Disease also includes several other features that make it a successful portfolio including consistent navigation, usable search, standards compliance, up to date information and effective monetization.\r\n\r\nI especially like Design Disease''s natural approach to monetization. First by simply offering services for hire, but also by offering the services of other companies such as HostGator for web hosting. Many websites try to increase revenue by placing banner ads chosen by key word, but Design Disease simply makes a natural recommendation. Just as a side-note, this is where I see the future of advertising headed.\r\n<h2>Bad Examples</h2>\r\nPoorly designed portfolio sites are naturally harder to find, as they don''t get as much attention, but some of the worst of the worst can be found by doing a Google search for "worst website ever". There are some websites, which I generally dislike. These aren''t necessarily bad websites, but sites that I feel could do a much better job at communicating their message.\r\n\r\nHave a look at the introduction page on <a title="Scott Rockers'' Portfolio" href="http://rockerssoft.org/scott/" target="_blank">Scott Rockers'' Portfolio</a>. While I can appreciate the intent to make sure that visitors are aware that the site is Flash-based, the introduction page is an unnecessary step for most visitors that gets in the way of the message of the site. The best solution would be to avoid Flash unless it is absolutely necessary (most multimedia and animations can be handled with HTML, CSS and JavaScript these days). However, even when Flash is necessary the question of whether or not the visitor has Flash player installed can be addressed by the computer. Don''t make visitors do the work that your website should do for them. Include a script to skip the intro page if Flash is installed.\r\n\r\nOne last example is <a title="Eyes Go Dark" href="http://eyesgodark.com" target="_blank">Eyes Go Dark</a>. Eyes Go Dark is an example of a great message that is poorly communicated. When the site first loads, there is an introduction page with several external links. While external links are fine, it doesn''t make sense for them to be the first thing a visitor sees. That''s like visiting a house and being shown the way out as you enter. Skip the intro page and show visitors what they came for. Your message and your content should be right up front welcoming the visitors to your site.', 'Basic Principles of Website Design', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '36-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-11-22 14:06:26', '2013-11-22 14:06:26', '', 36, 'http://josiahsprague.com/36-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

My vision is that my role as a  professional would become more and more aligned with my role as a teacher.\r\n\r\nThis past semester I had the opportunity to teach an elective communication class at Doulos.

(582, 1, '2014-01-13 14:25:19', '2014-01-13 14:25:19', 'When I first started working with Doulos, it reminded me a lot of my high school, Cuyahoga Valley Christian Academy. Both are private Christian schools where the staff care deeply about the spiritual development of the students, and there is a strong culture of academic excellence that stands out from other schools. I sometimes feel that there is more in common between the culture of Doulos and CVCA than there is between CVCA and public schools in Ohio. But after spending a couple of years here I’ve begun to realize that there are also many cultural differences, and I long for the students here to learn and expand their view of the world and to be able to understand the values of my home culture.\r\n\r\nThat’s why I am so excited about <a href="http://doulosdiscovery.org/launching-exciting-new-exchange-student-partnership/">a new exchange student partnership between Doulos and CVCA</a>. It began this past semester with two CVCA students who came to study for a semester here at Doulos. I was so proud to have students here representing my alma mater (and they represented it very well). This semester, I am thrilled that two Doulos students have the opportunity to represent their school as exchange students at CVCA.\r\n\r\nOne of those students happens to be one of the first students I met when I came to visit Doulos with a team in April 2012. We were visiting homes of Dominican Doulos staff and no one on our team knew Spanish, so Darina came with us to translate. It is very exciting for me that a student who played a key role in introducing me to Dominican culture now has the opportunity to experience my home culture at the same high school I attended.\r\n\r\nYou might assume that the connection between Doulos and CVCA came about because of an intentional effort on my part, or on the part of the Danae LeMoine (another Doulos staff member who attended high school at CVCA), but that isn’t the case. The exchange program, and Danae and myself being here, all came about completely separately. It was as if God was working all three together without awareness on our part.\r\n\r\nIt is exciting to see how God works in ways that we don’t expect or plan for, interweaving cultures and experiences within his diverse Church. My hope is that through this partnership between Doulos and CVCA that more and more people would see and celebrate that beautiful connection that we have in Christ regardless of our culture and background, and that it would enable us to value and love each other more deeply across those boundaries.', 'An Organic Connection Across Diverse Cultural Backgrounds', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '577-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-01-13 14:25:19', '2014-01-13 14:25:19', '', 577, 'http://josiahsprague.com/577-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(749, 1, '2014-03-10 18:51:39', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 'Christian Discipleship\n\nWe are disciples of Jesus Christ. That means following Him, being His “apprentice,” and learning to live out of a heart, mind and soul completely devoted to our Triune God. We seek to exalt Christ at every turn, teaching students how to be His disciples in every aspect of life, including the academic subjects. In those academic classes, we seek to be a Biblically Integrated school, holding fast to God’s word and teaching each class from the perspective that God is the foundation for all truth, and that anything we can study in His creation can only be well known if we know our Creator well.\n\n<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28.8px;"> </span>\n\nExpeditionary Learning\n\nWe use project-based learning expeditions that encourage high levels of student engagement, achievement, and character development. The value of expeditionary learning is that learning and leadership cannot be fully grasped in a traditional educational setting. We (our whole staff, not just students) take learning into our own hands and encourage each other to take supervised and calculated risks, to try, fail, and try again, and learn intangibles like teamwork, overcoming adversity, pushing oneself physically, and simply doing hard things. We inspire our students to be engaged and self-motivated learners by fostering students’ learning through fieldwork, experts, and product creation.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCalling Prep (College Prep)\n\nWe view higher education as a tool to equip students to live out their calling as disciples of Christ and develop the vocation to which God has called them. We prepare students academically, socially, and spiritually to attend college internationally. Our desire is for students to be academically, socially, and spiritually equipped for higher education at an institution of their choosing.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMixed Economic Student Body\n\nWe believe that leaders come from all economic backgrounds. In a country where people are often isolated from each other based on their families’ income levels, we attempt to bridge the gap by educating rich and poor together and building lasting relationships between socioeconomic classes by reserving half of our enrollment for full tuition-paying students and the other half for Christian families who prepare their children spiritually but are not able to provide for their academic needs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDominican\n\nDoulos is located in the town of Jarabacoa in the mountains of the Dominican Republic. We meet the standards of the Dominican Ministry of Education for international schools. We seek to honor local traditions, engage local leadership, and prepare our students to lead and impact within the country. Our school mascot is “the revolutionary,” and our desire is to see our students complete their post high school education internationally and then return to the Dominican Republic to take on revolutionary roles in the leadership of the country.', '', '', 'draft', 'open', 'open', '', '', '', '', '2014-03-10 18:51:39', '2014-03-10 18:51:39', '', 0, 'http://josiahsprague.com/?p=749', 0, 'post', '', 0),

(689, 1, '2014-03-02 22:35:54', '2014-03-02 22:35:54', 'Lately I''ve been feeling discouraged, feeling like its impossible to stay in the loop about what is happening at Doulos, so that I can do <a href="http://josiahsprague.com">my job of telling the story of the school</a>. Some of it touches on personal insecurity and fears of not being included by others, and other parts of it stem from finding too much of my identity in work. In other words, it''s been a deep soul-level discouragement.\r\n\r\nMy roommate, Eric, has also been discouraged, after a string of frustrating events with his job at <a href="http://www.sidominicanrepublic.com/dr/">Students International</a> and with <a href="http://josiahsprague.com/thank-god-that-he-is-justice/">our housing situation</a>. So both of us decided that this weekend would be a good time to escape to the beach for a day for some R&amp;R. We may have been more rested and recovered without it.\r\n\r\nAs <a href="http://josiahsprague.com/thank-god-that-he-is-justice/">I should have learned by now</a>, Eric''s car is not so reliable. About half way to the beach, on our way up a mountain, the car started to overheat. We stopped for awhile, opened the hood to check things out, and let the car cool down. While we waited, Eric told me how the radiator had exploded for the previous owner, splattering boiling coolant fluid all over the hood and windshield. We both agreed it would be good to take it easy driving up the mountains.\r\n\r\nOnce the car was cooled down and we were ready to get back on the road, we found that the hood wouldn''t latch securely. As we were trying to fix the latch, a Dominican driving by on his motorcycle stopped and helped us tie down the hood with a rubber strap. Definitely a hack, but it seemed like it would hold and soon we were back on our way, driving slowly up the mountain.\r\n\r\nOnce we were over the mountain, and coming back down the other side, we were able to drive faster again, since the engine wasn''t being pushed so hard and the airflow was keeping things cool. We were cruising along, happily approaching the beach at 50mph when suddenly, BOOM! The hood of the car flew up, shattering the windshield in our faces and blocking our vision! Thankfully, no glass actually cut our faces or got in our eyes, and we were on a straight road and Eric was able to safely stop the car before we hit anything or ended up off-road in a huge ditch or down the side of a mountain.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://instagram.com/p/WYGSfuTUSk/"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-296" alt="windshield" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/windshield-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nThough public infrastructure and assistance isn''t so common, Dominicans are very eager to help a stranger. Within 30 seconds, another Dominican stopped to help. He was the manager of <a href="http://www.bahia-principe.com/en/">a garage about five minutes away</a>, so he helped us get the car there, where they removed the windshield and used an air compressor to blow all of the glass fragments off of the dashboard and seats. A couple of hours later, we were back on our way to the beach.\r\n\r\nWe had left at 9:30 in the morning to go to a beach less than two hours away. By the time we got there, it was 3:30 in the afternoon. We got to swim in a <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/KJy7h">beautiful crystal clear ocean</a>, and read in our <a href="http://www.socohammocks.com/">SoCo Hammocks</a> for a few hours. We had a nice Dominican-style dinner, and then drove three hours slowly back to Jarabacoa without a windshield, and nervously watching the temperature gauge to make sure that the radiator wouldn''t overheat and explode.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://instagram.com/p/WZe3GgzUS8/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-297" alt="Dominican Food" src="http://josiahsprague.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dominican-food-presidente-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>\r\n\r\nNeither of us has any idea why we''ve experienced such a string of crazy events. But we both agree that living in the Dominican Republic is teaching us to go with the flow and realize that not everything is always under our control, but that''s ok. We''re learning to be more patient and to accept things for how the are. And to be thankful for what we have, because it really is a lot, even when we hit a rough patch or lose something valuable.', 'Learning to Go With the Flow', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '292-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-03-02 22:35:54', '2014-03-02 22:35:54', '', 292, 'http://josiahsprague.com/292-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

We would prefer to stay safely in our homes, not risking failure, loss or rejection.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spent as much time as anyone trying to evade hardship, and if you’ve read my blog, or if you’re subscribed to my newsletter,&nbsp;you know that I’ve been faced many times in the last few months with the choice to either avoid suffering or to endure it.</p>\n<p>We often miss out on the best things in life by rejecting and avoiding painful experiences, but when we embrace suffering, we often find that the result of our endurance is worth the price that we have paid.</p>\n<p>This weekend, a group of guys from Doulos climbed Pico Duarte, the highest mountain in the Carribean. I knew it would be challenging, but the other mountains I’ve climbed are nothing compared to Pico Duarte. It took us three days to hike the mountain, but by the middle of the first day’s hike, I didn’t want to take another step. I didn’t want to suffer for two more days just to see a view and go home.

But I also read <a href="http://www.youversion.com/bible/1cor.1.niv" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push([''_trackEvent'',''outbound-article'',''http://www.youversion.com'']);">a letter</a> this morning that was written by a greek leader the Christian Church in the first century A.D. to his followers.</p>\n<p>He reminded his followers that his purpose as a leader was “to preach the Gospel, not in cleverness of speech” lest Christ’s sacrifice be made void.&nbsp;And I was reminded, as I leave behind the career path that I’ve spent so much time pondering and seek an unconventional opportunity, that the purpose of my career is not to lead people to cleverness of web development, as I so often desire, but to lead people to Christ.</p>', 'Thoughts on Leadership', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '17-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-03-03 00:50:38', '2014-03-03 00:50:38', '', 17, 'http://josiahsprague.com/17-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(779, 1, '2014-04-05 18:00:33', '2014-04-05 18:00:33', '“Do you want to go to the reservoir with us tomorrow?”\r\n\r\nA cute Dominican friend asks me, as I struggle to keep up with her rapid Spanish.\r\n\r\n“¡Claro que si!” I reply.\r\n\r\n“Great! Can you drive?”\r\n\r\nShoot. I don’t own a car. When I need to, I borrow my roommate’s CRV, but he left on his motorcycle a few hours earlier to go camping. He won’t have cell service and won’t be back for two days.\r\n\r\n“¡Si!” I reply simply. My Spanish is not very good yet. I can’t easily explain that I’ll have to borrow my roommate’s car without asking. But she’s cute; better to ask forgiveness than permission, right?\r\n\r\nI show up early in the morning at the same time as a few more of her friends who are joining us in a four wheeler and a dune buggy. A few cousins, aunts, and a small child fill up the CRV. I can’t follow the rapid-fire Spanish conversation, but I catch “Vamos!” Let’s go!\r\n\r\nWe start off on the 45 minute drive through bumpy mountain roads. I’m trying to keep up with the two vehicles in front. How do Dominicans drive so fast on these roads?\r\n\r\nWe’re headed up the side of a mountain half way to the reservoir, when all of the sudden, the rattle of the CRV’s questionable suspension becomes a much more violent vibration and the car slides off to the side of the road and comes to a halt.\r\n\r\nI get out and take a look. Both front wheels are pointed inward. We’re not going anywhere. I learned the word for “tow truck” the day before.\r\n\r\n“Does anyone know a <em>grúa</em> we can call?”\r\n\r\nIt’s Sunday. All of the shops are closed. We’re going to be here for awhile.\r\n\r\nI sit down on the side of the road and start to feel bad about borrowing my roommates car without asking. I feel bad that everyone was excited to go to the reservoir and now we’re stuck on the side of a hot, dusty, country road for the rest of the day. I’m about to get ticked at the whole situation.\r\n\r\n“You want some cookies?” I hear, as I start forming apologies in my head. I look up to see a six year old grinning and waving cookies at me while everyone else is sitting in the shade by the side of the road, getting drinks out of the cooler, enjoying the day as if nothing happened. No apologies necessary.\r\n\r\nThe cow pasture we’re next to isn''t the exciting destination I had in mind. But my Dominican friends didn''t even seem to notice. They realized something that I didn''t at first;\r\n<blockquote>The destination isn''t the point. The point is the journey you’re on, and the people you’re with.</blockquote>\r\nEventually, several hours later, a tow truck came, and I was able to get the CRV fixed before returning it to my roommate, but lesson learned;\r\n<blockquote>Life is chaotic. You don’t always end up where you had set out to go. Stop and look who is beside you on the road or you might miss the point.</blockquote>\r\nAnd don’t borrow your roommate’s car without asking. <i class="icon-twitter">.</i>', 'The Destination Isn''t The Point', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '690-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-04-05 18:00:33', '2014-04-05 18:00:33', '', 690, 'http://josiahsprague.com/690-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The Spanish Language Institute (SLI) offers up to 7 weeks of intensive Spanish classes, four hours a day with experienced native speakers that will help you achieve fluency. If you''ve been waiting for an excuse to come visit Doulos, this is it!</p>\n&nbsp;\n<p dir="ltr">The Spanish Language Institute was established to prepare individuals to serve in the Dominican Republic and Spanish-speaking communities around the world. SLI forms an important part of our mission at Doulos Discovery School to educate and equip servant leaders. SLI is preparation for communication and mutual understanding. If you are considering or preparing for a service project in Latin America, want to supplement or refresh your Spanish, or simply want to experience life in the mountains of the Cordillera Central and kick back under a mango tree, we welcome you with open arms.</p>\n&nbsp;\n<p dir="ltr">Over the summer, the bilingual campus of Doulos transforms into a Spanish-only zone. For effective language learning, practice and persistence are important, but the real catalyst is immersion. We ask all our students to commit to only speaking Spanish while they are on campus in order to accelerate their learning as well as that of their peers. Agreeing to only speak Spanish is more than just a language-learning tool, but it is a life lesson about the rewards of persistence and dedication. <img alt="edit" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pzbkWndt9xjHKWrtv29kNEHzCeUkq6L-6p34ac-moTSm7V3myTnTqKprrk4J29syIhfUIdRjCw2Q8IJKm9wUkzyB1EXDga7X9RTAgWP2bPYdryOuNcpv8uv_d288-Q" width="400px;" height="400px;" /></p>\n&nbsp;\n<p dir="ltr">During your time at SLI you will stay with a Spanish-speaking host family, which will help you quickly pick up everyday Spanish used in the home, while your time in class will give you the tools you need to learn proper grammar and pronunciation and increase your understanding. You will also get to participate in cultural workshops, take tours of Jarabacoa and watch and discuss Spanish films with the group. On the weekends, <a href="http://doulosdiscovery.org/opportunities/spanish-language-institute/excursions/">SLI excursions </a>will take you around the island to visit Santo Domingo, 27 Waterfalls, Spirit Mountain Coffee Farm, and Paradise Island among others. Doulos encourages learning inside and outside the classroom and this philosophy extends to SLI. Our desire for students during the excursions is that they can use Spanish for personal enrichment by indulging their curiosity and experiencing the wonders of the Dominican Republic, as well as getting some excellent Spanish practice!</p>\n&nbsp;\n<p dir="ltr">If you want to improve your Spanish while having the experience of a lifetime, we hope you''ll make plans to join us this summer for our Spanish Language Institute. Apply today, tell a friend, and don’t forget to pack your sunscreen!</p>\n&nbsp;', '', '', 'draft', 'open', 'open', '', '', '', '', '2014-03-17 18:41:49', '2014-03-17 18:41:49', '', 0, 'http://josiahsprague.com/?p=759', 0, 'post', '', 0),
